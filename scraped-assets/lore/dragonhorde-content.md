## Common Questions

### What are the benefits of holding a Dragon?
Holding a Dragonhorde will be essential with our upcoming yield utility coming to the Moonrunners ecosystem, where we plan to offer unparalleled value and yield with innovative rewards never seen before in WEB3. To maximize your yield benefits, holders will want to keep at least one Dragonhorde staked.

Being a Dragonhorde holder also entitles you to numerous exclusive benefits, experiences, and opportunities including a suite of trading tools with our partners. Our mint includes a reroll function where holders can burn a weapon from our "Moonrunners: Secrets of Primordia" collection to obtain a brand new dragon. We will also be rolling out FUSION, which will involve REDACTED a Moonrunners and Dragonhorde to create a REDACTED.

We have plenty of activations planned for Dragonhorde, including a big feature in our upcoming interactive season 5 lore that Dragonhorde can participate in.

### How many Dragons are mintable?
There will be 1500 mintable which includes 3 legendary Dragonhorde. The allocation includes selected top tier partners. Staked Moonrunner wallets will also have the chance to mint at our reduced price.

### What's the collection size?
The collection size is estimated to sit around or less than 4,000 Dragonhorde with the additional blood burn to Dragonhorde functionality rolling out after our mint. Blood was earned through our on-chain Dragon game released in 2022. This will include a total of 15 Legendary Dragonhorde after reroll functionality in The Alchemy Lab, including 1 Legendary Dragonhorde egg which will grant the holder additional benefits.

### How do I burn my dragon blood?
Head on over to the Alchemy Lab once our 1500 Dragonhorde mint collection is complete, and select the number of bloods you would like to burn. Exact burn statistics will be found in the Alchemy Lab that will break down the number of bloods you need to burn to redeem one Dragonhorde at each rarity level. The burn function is open perpetually, and can be done at any time. Blood to Dragonhorde rarity corresponds to the rarity of blood burn. E.G 1 Rare Nebu blood = 1 Rare D3 Dragonhorde.

### What is the mint price?
- Whitelist: 0.079 ETH per Dragonhorde, max 2 per transaction.
- Public: 0.079 ETH per Dragonhorde, max 2 per transaction.

### When is the reveal?
The reveal from incubators to Dragonhorde will be approx 3-7 days. Legendaries will be revealed after D1,D2,D3 separately.
