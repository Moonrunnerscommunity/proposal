# The Den - FAQ Content (Scraped from theden.moonrunners.io/faq)

## THE DEN
The Den is your new home on Primordia, a space where all new features will be announced and ancient lore will be revealed.
A living, breathing, organism that is constantly expanding and introducing new value to both veteran Moonrunners and new recruits.

## PLEDGE TO PRIMORDIA
Moonrunners was built on doing shit differently. That's why we're introducing the Soulbound NFTs staking rewards system. Simply stake your Moonrunner to Primordia in The Den and earn rewards, win prizes, and unlock future utility. The Soulbound staking system is how we plan to grow the ecosystem into a more interactive and value-driven experience.

## Trophy System
What's a trophy and how do I get one? Trophies are achievements you can earn by staking your Moonrunner and creating a Soulbound. These trophies stay in your wallet as a claimable NFT. They cannot be traded as they are Soulbound to your wallet address. Trophies create more utility, more access, better value, and reward loyal Moonrunners - AWWOOOO.

## The Trophies
- Bronze
- Silver  
- Gold
- Diamond
- Wolf of Fame

Rewards of the soulbounds do not stack.

### Trophy Requirements
- Bronze is acquired by staking 1 Moonrunner for 30 days
- Silver is acquired by staking 5 Moonrunners for 30 days
- Gold is acquired by staking 10 Moonrunners for 30 days
- Diamond is acquired by staking 25 Moonrunners for 30 days

The Wolf of Fame is selected by the team to show appreciation for notable community members who exceed expectations. These will be airdropped, and cannot be traded. You will also receive Discord status.

## Don't forget!
To maintain the benefits of your Soulbound trophy, you will need the trophy and the number of staked runners the trophy represents. For example, if you earn a gold trophy after staking 10 Moonrunners for 30 days, but then un-stake 2 of your Moonrunners, your gold trophy will become void and you will have to claim a lower tier trophy to be eligible for its benefits. This applies to other utilities, including participation in our raffle system, using your Soulbound for discounts on future Moonrunners drops and more.

## FAQ: If I unlock a Silver Soulbound Trophy, then purchase and stake more, do I need to wait another 30 days?
No - if you keep your other Moonrunners staked, and purchase enough to stake the additional requirement after your 30 days is complete, you will automatically move up to the next tier.

## FAQ: What sort of utility can I expect from my soulbound trophy?
Your Soulbound trophy reflects your holdings within the Moonrunners ecosystem. Holding a Soulbound trophy and NFT, will give you access to surprise raffles in The Den. If you have a higher level Soulbound trophy, you will be eligible for exclusive raffles and a chance to win valuable NFTs and assets. By holding the trophy, you can enter for a chance to win. Trophies or being in the Moonrunners ecosystem may also give you discounts off future collection mints, expansions and other products under the Moonrunners umbrella. Soulbounds may be integrated into our games, future NFT projects and ecosystems to provide value and exclusivity including partner utility access. We plan to continue to add value to our Soulbound trophy system. We will constantly look at new and innovative ways to integrate our SBTs to provide value and benefits.
