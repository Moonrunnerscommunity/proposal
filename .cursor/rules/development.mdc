- **Development Server Management:**
  - **NEVER start development servers** (npm run dev, yarn dev, etc.) - the user will start these themselves
  - **NEVER run background processes** that the user should control
  - **NEVER assume the user wants servers running** - always let them decide when to start/stop services
  - Only suggest starting servers in plain text, never execute the commands

- **Development Workflow:**
  - Focus on code implementation and file creation/editing
  - Let the user control their development environment
  - Provide suggestions for testing but don't execute them
  - If verification is needed, suggest the user run the appropriate commands

- **Command Execution Guidelines:**
  - **DO:** Run commands that gather information (ls, cat, grep, etc.)
  - **DO:** Run build commands when explicitly requested
  - **DO:** Install dependencies when working on package.json changes
  - **DON'T:** Start long-running processes
  - **DON'T:** Start servers, watchers, or development tools
  - **DON'T:** Run commands that might interfere with user's workflow

- **Testing and Verification:**
  - Suggest testing approaches rather than executing them
  - Let the user run their own tests and provide feedback
  - Focus on code quality and structure rather than runtime verification
