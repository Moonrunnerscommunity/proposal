on the todo list page:
- if a task is completed, add a new element, a single row, at the top of its box:
    - a smaller, grey version of the number bubble
    - muted/grey/italic crossed out text version of the task title
    - no additional details, description, or status indicator
    - to the far right, a down carat indicating that the task is expandable
    - default the task to collapsed
    - when expanded, it shows the task exactly as it shows now
    - a task is not marked as completed and collapsed unless all of its subtasks are also completed and collapsed
- under 2a, retry failed downloads:
    - add a table display with one row for each id to be researched, columns for id, collection, status, etc.
    - research each nft individually, and update the table with the results of your investigation. i believe you were working on that last night when we got disconnected, but you were using infura to look it up.
- on the contracts page, make the non-transferred contracts appear grey and muted. greyscale image, grey background, grey text, etc. make the Not Transferred label yellow so it's the only thing that has color in the box. add a callout to the top of those contract's pages mentioned explicitely that these contracts were not transferred and are not currently part of Moonrunners 2.0, but we will be researching gap solutions in the future.
- put a little header in the contracts sidebar for Contracts, a little more prominent than the collections and miscellaneous headers

# round 2

- collapsible todos:
    - when expanded, the font size of the crossed out item changes, it's position moves, the carat moves, the padding changes, and the bar is not connected to the rest of the task as if its a part of it. it should be.
    - add a green check back in. i want to see it in the collapsed state, to the left of the carat.
- under restore nft images:
    - moonrunners and dragonhorde contracts are complete
- on the contracts page, i don't see any greyed out contracts. it should be primordia land and history of primordia. this was the instruction:
    - on the contracts page, make the non-transferred contracts appear grey and muted. greyscale image, grey background, grey text, etc. make the Not Transferred label yellow so it's the only thing that has color in the box. add a callout to the top of those contract's pages mentioned explicitely that these contracts were not transferred and are not currently part of Moonrunners 2.0, but we will be researching gap solutions in the future.
