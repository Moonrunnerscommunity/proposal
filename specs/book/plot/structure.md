# Plot Structure

## Book One: The Awakening

**Act One (Ch 1-8):** Monica summoned. Meets Kael, Vex. Discovers the "resistance" is three wolves in a cave. Learns she's Brave tribe — worst match for someone who's spent her life avoiding risk. Realizes she has to build everything from scratch.

**Act Two (Ch 9-20):** Building the revolution. First recruits. First failures. Learning to work with wolves who don't trust each other. The Minted notice. Assassins sent. Monica starts to find her footing—not as a leader, but as a builder.

**Act Three (Ch 21-28):** The Brave Trial approaches. The Drop she can handle. The Truth Circle terrifies her—she'll have to admit why she's really here. Assassination attempt during trial. First Minting under siege. She has to leap.

**Cliffhanger:** She passes. First Minting succeeds. Then: "There's something you should know about the first summoning."
