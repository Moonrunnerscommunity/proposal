# Moonrunners: The Awakening

## Back Cover

Ten years ago, Monica Laminsky's college roommate asked her to co-found a startup. Monica said no. Took the safe job. Watched her roommate build something that mattered and sell it for eight figures.

Now she's a senior product manager. She ships features. She hits OKRs. She builds things for other people.

When she is unexpectedly summoned from a sprint planning meeting into a magical world of talking wolves embroiled in a thousand-year class war, she discovers that the resistance was already waiting for her.

All three of them. In a cave. With a manifesto scratched on bark.

They want her to build a revolution from nothing: no army, no plan, no infrastructure. Just a few true believers and a dream. And a weird frog and a tiny but mostly friendly goblin.

The aristocracy has held power for a thousand years. Now they're sending assassins.

She's been building products her whole career. Now she's building the startup she was always too scared to join.

She said no once.

She's not saying no again.

*The revolution might not be optimized. But it will ship on time.*
