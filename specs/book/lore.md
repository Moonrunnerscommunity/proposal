# Moonrunners Lore

## Season 1: A New Age

Long before the first cities of Primordia, the land was shared in harmony between men and wolves, the latter being known as Moonrunners.

Over a millennium of peace would be shattered in an event that in later centuries came to be called the Crimson Flood.

The unbroken peace has been maintained by a gifted castle of men known as Moonspeakers, capable of translating wolven speech.

Their role in society was revered by all of Primordia, which made their ultimate betrayal of mankind unfathomable...

---

Humanity developed at an unsustainable pace, risking life for all on Primordia, especially wolves.

Moonspeakers beseeched man to change their ways and not risk destroying the ancestral hunting grounds of Moonrunners, vital to their way of life.

Moonrunners, tired of the arrogance of man and to save themselves from inevitable extinction, massacred human cities across Primordia.

Thus sparking a bloody wolven crusade known as the Crimson Flood...

---

For the first time in history, wolves and man had turned bitter enemies. With mankind seeing the Crimson Flood as an unprovoked and irreversible attack.

The technological advancements of humanity allowed their weapons to rapidly develop past the capabilities of Moonrunners' defences.

Within a few years the wolven population has been decimated with only 10,000 fighters remaining, but they had a secret weapon up their sleeves...

The full moon is coming... be prepared.

---

The Moonspeakers, having forever eschewed violence, were disgusted by the force used by man, and deflected to join the Moonrunners.

Their deep understanding of human tactics and its weaknesses allowed them to become Wolf Trainers.

As their bond strengthened, Wolf Trainers discovered a deeper, long forgotten connection to the Moonrunners.

On every full moon, visions revealed themselves to the Trainers. These prophecies were heralded as the final hope to turn the tide of the war.

---

Among these new prophecies came a revelation...

A powerful and rare full moon approached, a syzygy that would conceal the planet Carousa in the night sky and usher in a new age for the Lycans.

---

As the golden record voyages through space, its radiance illuminates all. We see the hues of every mare, deep and dark but never tall.

Primordia and Earth are as a mirror, but rarely does it fall. When our cycle begins anew, the crimson flood shall cast a pall

---

Primordia is an ancient, fractured planet, home to the Hunter, Predator, Pack, Stealth, Roaming, and Brave tribes.

Each with its own deep-rooted history and traditions, honed over thousands of years of spilled blood and a hunger to survive the harsh landscape.

A single Moonspeaker was permitted to live amongst each tribe, acting as a bridge between wolves and humans.

Their deep knowledge of humankind proved vital in training wolves for the catastrophic war to come.

---

### The Brave Tribe

Foolhardy and courageous, the Brave Tribe is one of the most dominant on Primordia.

They reigned on Primordia for millennia, subjugating smaller tribes through violence and fear.

Since the Crimson Tide however, their thirst for war has shifted to vanquishing humankind.

---

### The Hunter Tribe

A tribe impossible to elude, the Hunter Tribe's divergent evolution has made them master trackers on Primordia.

Their sensory ability allowed them to easily find and stockpile resources, making them the most economically powerful tribe.

In times of war, they conduct dangerous reconnaissance and scouting missions deep into enemy territory.

---

### The Stealth Tribe

Masters of misdirection, and camouflage, the Stealth Tribe is rarely seen outside their cities, despite being intrepid explorers.

Their cunning tactics cause mayhem for humankind, who feared them as ghosts.

Their ability to mask their scent, and conceal their tracks made them perfect assassins.

---

### The Pack Tribe

Focused on peace-keeping between tribes and being the most sociable of all wolves.

Their strong ties to neighboring tribes and close proximity to human cities has positioned them to act as messengers and intercept enemy communication.

However, their location and peaceful nature has left them defenseless and at risk of being the first Tribe to be overrun in a human counter-attack.

---

### The Roaming Tribe

Forced migrations due to human occupation displaced the Roaming Tribe's early ancestors.

Despite their exodus, they found freedom in a nomadic lifestyle and mapped all of Primordia through oral tradition.

Their deep knowledge of Primordia's vast landscape made them expert tacticians in pitched battles, and war maneuvers with humankind.

---

### The Predator Tribe

Ruthless and bloodthirsty, the Predator Tribe are Primordia's berserker class. Where they go, carnage follows.

Humanity, realizing the risk they posed to morale, relentlessly targeted their tribal grounds, decimating their population.

This emboldened the survivors to fight with a vengeance never before seen, never surrendering and to the death.

---

Darkness fills the night and the hearts of the Pack Tribe. Their newborn pup Nogard, has been kidnapped, striking fear and fury into the tribe.

A hunt for the perpetrator has begun. The Pack Tribe, inexperienced in tracking, has called on the Hunter Tribe for aid.

Their elders convened a council, and magnanimously sent their most experienced hunters to find clues.

---

Their senses heightened to exact vengeance, the lead hunters finally discovered Nogard, laid across a bloodsoaked altar.

Their hackles raised to the moon, they unleashed a pained howl that was heard across Primordia.

The eyes of the lifeless corpse were trapped in a state of terror. Surrounded by ritual signs only Moonspeakers could understand and human tools, the Pack Tribe immediately blamed the humans, but Hunter Tribe found tracks they couldn't explain.

---

Showcasing their prowess, Hunter tribe utilized the scent obtained from the tools left at the ritual site to track and capture the perpetrator...a human.

As the enraged Predator interrogations began, the human coward confessed to the heinous crime and stated he'd gladly do it again. Swiftly, the human reached for his blood stained dagger, muttering a phrase in a foreign tongue, and slit his own throat.

---

Finally united, the Tribes gathered in a show of solidarity, knowing this tragedy could have been their own.

Nogard's parents' impassioned plea for revenge resonated across the tribal gathering held on shared wolven ground.

The wolves dug their claws into the dirt as the trainers clenched their fists, eyes darted in the crowd with a common understanding - that war was coming.

---

Arriving one by one, cloaked in tattered robes, the Moonspeakers sat down silently.

The dank, stone room, deep in the Predator Tribe mountains, hadn't seen life for thousands of years. Furtive nods were exchanged and the meeting commenced.

The flambeaux cast shadows that danced across the large obsidian table. A consensus was quickly reached that an auspicious day was coming unexplainable but sensed by all present. They would have to wait for the full moon to launch their attack.

---

A full moon unlike any ever seen by those living on Primordia. The distant light of Carousa glowed faintly behind the moon, casting a potent omen.

Something is coming for those on Primordia, something powerful. All eyes to the night sky.

Confusion was quickly followed by panic as the Moonspeakers began to disappear. Stealth Tribe wolves, forever lurking as shadows across the land, witnessed their frenzied cries for help. Unsure how to intervene, they reported it to the other Tribes.

---

Deep in the forests across Primordia, the Moonspeakers withered in agony. A power unknown to them coursed a fire through their veins, transforming them beyond recognition. The time of the Lycan had finally come.

---

War howls broke the silence of the night as every Tribe across Primordia assembled on the battlefield.

Their fur glistened in the moonlight as they took their positions, agreed upon by the shared war knowledge of the Brave and Pack Tribes.

Seething with anger, and a thirst for vengeance for the death of Nogard, the wolves growled, hackles rising, as their incisors dripped in anticipation.

Ever confident in their technology, humanity stood listlessly, staring as thousands of wolves gathered before them.

---

Tribes, once bitter enemies, braced shoulder to shoulder, in their assigned battalions.

The Predator Tribe, already war-scarred from earlier skirmishing, stood at the vanguard, eyes hollow, unblinking, at the enemy before them.

The howling subsided and the field finally lay silent, broken only by the guttural breathing of the wolves.

After a moment of calm, the humans slowly began their march forward, robotic in their synchronicity, towards the wolves.

---

Howls erupted across the plain, sending cold shudders down the spines of the humans.

At a speed inconceivable to those present, the Predator Tribe struck first wreaking mayhem, and devastating the unprepared human frontline.

Humans launched fire attacks, scorching the hides of battling wolves. Thanks to the lessons of the Moonspeakers, the Brave Tribe sought out and destroyed the human war machines - a diversion that allowed the Stealth Tribe to sneak behind enemy lines.

---

The battle raged on, caking the soil in the blood of both man and wolf. Entire wolven families slaughtered, further lowering dwindling tribal numbers.

Many were saved thanks to the aid of the Pack Tribe and the supplies of Hunter Tribe.

Humans launched a fierce armoured tank attack that even the Moonspeakers had not prepared them for.

The wolves immediately sensed they were powerless against such weapons, gripping their army in a pang of fear that this war would now be lost.

---

From behind wolven lines a creature never before seen, emerged from deep within the forest, a hybrid that at first the wolves thought was a human weapon.

But as they raced past the wolves towards the human army the wolven legends sunk in - they were in the presence of Lycans.

The Lycans, with a strength unlike anything thought possible, tore through the tanks, tipping them, tearing off their turrets and bending the cannon as if they were wire. The wolves overran the remaining tanks and slaughtered the few that survived the Lycan assault.

---

Human morale began to falter as the tide began to turn in the wolves favor. The human death throes and wolven whimpers were overpowered by the ongoing howls, and clang of weapons on the battlefield. A requiem etched into the mind of all survivors.

The Stealth Tribe, finding the enemy command center, assassinated the guards and signalled with a special howl to the few remaining Predator Tribe fighters. Hearing the call they weaved a sinuous path at lightning speed through the battlefield into the building.

The Stealth Tribe assassins looked away in horror as the Predator Tribe massacred the entire room of terrified human officers in a gruesome display of ferocity and gore. Without leadership and proper lines of communication, the human front collapsed.

---

The two day battle was finally over as the remaining humans surrendered and the Tribes began to tend to their casualties.

The wolves understood that it was a pyrrhic victory, and mourned the loss of their comrades across all Tribes.

---

Snouts raised to the night sky, the wolves sang in honor of their fallen. The howls echoed through the valleys and mountains of Primordia, a somber reminder of the cost of war.

Among the ruins of the battlefield, the wolves discovered strange eggs, unlike anything they had ever seen. Their origin was a mystery, but their presence filled the wolves with unease.

---

## Season 2: Nogard's Revenge

Hidden amongst the fallen, safely in the wolven ossuary, the eggs sat undisturbed.

Whispers became murmurs, and hope turned into fear as the origin of the eggs spread rumours like wildfire through the ranks.

---

Five of twelve, in the darkness where it did dwell

Obsidian armor tessellated from the pits of hell

Truth lies in plain sight, a sacrifice in the night

Chaos shall return, Primordia must needs fight

The die have been cast, the future cannot be changed

Romanced in latin, the runes have been rearranged

A legend thought lost shall be reborn once more

Only those loyal can possibly know what's in store

---

The grand hall packed beyond belief, eagerly awaited for the Speaker to commence the long-awaited meeting. Now that all the tribes were present, a final snapshot could be taken for the treasury to begin dealing out the loot.

The Speaker implored the wolves to hold onto their reward with pride, as they believed it would be indispensable in what was to come. To ensure fairness, they agreed that the spoils of war would be distributed in a randomized fashion amongst the pack.

It was decided that the wolven families that suffered the loss of their kin in the great war would receive a rare salvaged item for their service in battle.

---

For the first time in its history the ossuary held more living than dead. The wolves packed the dank chamber to witness for themselves if the eggs had indeed grown in size. A consensus was soon reached, and it held grave portents for their future.

Concern quickly spread throughout the tribes and the distant reaches of Primordia. The eggs were truly growing and what lay inside was anybody's guess.

The Moonspeakers were called in to deliberate on their origin...

---

Using arcane scrolls, runes, and shared oral history of each Tribe, the Moonspeakers slowly began to piece together the clues.

Eyes widened in terror when they realized the truth of what lay before them.

The eggs were Dragon Eggs.

---

Carouza was an enigma to the wolves. Shrouded in mystery, few knew its potential until the syzygy. Lycans however, weren't the only consequence of the alignment. A fact the wolves would soon be faced with.

Primordia is home to many astounding creatures, and many that could only be described as hellspawn. Above ground wolves reigned supreme, but below, terrors lurked in the darkness.

Knowledge of the effects of the alignment were lost to time. But those that studied the stars understood the rarity of what was to come.

---

After the human loss in the great war, technologies previously unknown to the wolves made their way into Tribal arsenals. Despite wolves relying on their physical prowess to overwhelm their enemies, many have begun to adopt modern weaponry to get an edge in battle.

Wolves, historically, have scorned human weaponry, preferring to fight in the heat of the melee. Elders had lauded the ability to outmaneuver and overwhelm the enemy and watch the life drain from their body as the highest form of combat.

After the substantial loss of life in the great war to human weaponry and technology, many wolves became frustrated with the old ways and beseeched their elders to change their traditions to embrace a new age.

The elders, realizing their mistake, began to work with the Moonspeakers to incorporate new weapons into war training.

---

Among the items left behind at the site of Nogard's murder was a strange parchment filled with symbols and numbers. After its scent led the wolves nowhere, they passed it onto the Moonspeakers who took it upon themselves to decipher it.

The Moonspeakers studied the parchment for hours to no avail. It was unlike anything they had ever seen in human culture. They decided to share the code amongst the tribes to see if anyone was able to solve it.

*The answer is at your fingertips, step by step, line by line. Assemble the Wolfpack.*

---

Something strange took hold of Primordia, the clear blue sky morphed into a purple hue. Ancient lore had described such an event, sending further ripples of fear throughout Moonspeakers and the wolves.

The Moonspeakers gathered all the great tribal families together to share their findings. The wolves slowly edged forward as if in search for answers, while the Speaker fumbled his parchment with tremorous hands.

He uttered a single word - Dragon.

Howls filled the valley as news spread about the danger that lay ahead. Arguments erupted between wolves that sought to destroy the eggs and those that wished to keep them safe.

---

The endless howls roused the Dragon from its long slumber deep in the mountain cave. Suddenly, a deafeningly shrill noise was heard across Primordia, sending boulders tumbling down the mountain. The Dragon saw its nest, empty and cold.

---

The Brave Tribe, emboldened by their victory in the great war however, did not shy away from the battle that was to come, and began preparing training exercises. Unsure of how to fight a Dragon they turned to the Moonspeakers for guidance.

Defenses and fortifications were prepared across every Tribal land at a frantic pace. Bunkers were built into the ground to protect the wolves, who were helpless from aerial attacks.

---

High above the clouds the wolves watched, helpless, as a purple Dragon capable of blotting out the sun flew overhead in menacing circles. The wolves stared in awe, watching in horror, waiting to see what the Dragon would do.

Suddenly, the Dragon, spotting signs of life below, began plummeting to the ground in what looked like a death spiral. Its bellow sent shockwaves throughout Primordia. Without flinching wolves began scattering to safety.

---

The Dragon's scales glinted in the sunlight as its maw stretched open and a purple orb blazed within. It opened its enormous wings and began gliding just above the treetops, scorching everything in sight.

Through the ashen sky, the dying light of the full moon began to fade into oblivion. All that remained in the dark night was chaos. The fire spread through the forests like an avalanche, obliterating everything in sight.

A cacophonous symphony of wolves baying into the night marked the beginning of Kalanant's wrath across Primordia. Darkness blanketed the planet as the smoke from wildfires spread across the planet.

---

Wolves cowering in the bunker struggled to breathe as smoke seeped into every vent and crevice. The nightmare seemed eternal as the ground rumbled every time Kalanant unleashed her wrath in search of her eggs.

Knowing her eggs were immune to fire, Kalanant spread her destruction across the entire planet, hoping to extinguish all other life, especially any that could threaten her offspring.

---

Days had passed and it finally seemed the end was near. Primordia ceased trembling and the smoke began to dissipate, revealing the beautiful purple sky. A thick layer of ash had blanketed Primordia in an apocalyptic pall.

Kalanant, exhausted from searching for her eggs, retreated to her cave atop the mountain to recuperate.

The landscape before them was unrecognizable. Lush tribal lands had become wastelands devoid of life. The wolves stared numbly at the destruction that lay before them.

---

A council was convened to decide the best course of action to protect the Tribes from future attacks from the Dragon. Some argued for better defenses and others for an immediate counterattack.

It was decided that living in constant fear of a Dragon was unsustainable and that all fighting wolves should be assembled and go in search of Kalanant's lair.

---

Wolves piled into the armory and took everything in sight. Combat Claws, spine-mounted AR-15s, Eldritch Scrolls, and Arcane Ray Guns. Having never fought a Dragon before, many wolves were unsure of the best course of action.

A resounding consensus was reached that the best time to attack was while the dragon slept. Relying on their ghostlike hunting skills, Stealth Tribe offered to lead the journey into the heart of the mountain.

---

All was quiet in the brisk morning air as the wolves, armed once again for war, mustered into an unbroken chain at the path leading up the mountain. Standing amidst the destruction all around them many wolves shivered nervously in the cold, fearing for their life.

Slowly the march began, up the mountain path, skirting crags in search of Kalanant's lair. Wolves began to notice faded runes lining the path.

---

Almost a full day into the march a soft howl was heard - the entrance had finally been found. The Stealth Tribe scout stared into the dark abyss, too terrified to venture inside.

The vantage point atop the mountain allowed the wolves to see the true extent of destruction caused by Kalanant.

---

Deeper and deeper into the mountain the wolves ventured, guided only by the faint glow of bioluminescent fungi on the cave walls.

The air grew thick and hot as they approached the dragon's lair. The sound of deep, rhythmic breathing echoed through the tunnels.

---

They found Kalanant slumbering atop a mountain of gold and treasures stolen from human cities. Her scales shimmered even in the darkness, each one as large as a wolf's shield.

The wolves crept forward, weapons at the ready, hearts pounding in their chests.

---

The battle that ensued shook the very foundations of the mountain. Fire and fury clashed against tooth and claw.

Many wolves fell, but they fought with the desperation of a species fighting for survival.

---

The injured were carried to safety by their packmates, their howls of pain echoing through the caverns.

But the wolves did not retreat. They had come too far, sacrificed too much.

---

In the end, it was the Lycans who turned the tide. Their hybrid strength proved too much even for Kalanant.

With a final, earth-shaking roar, the great dragon fell.

---

As Kalanant's body lay still, something miraculous happened. From the pools of dragon blood, a small figure emerged.

It was Nogard. Reborn. Transformed by the dragon's essence.

---

The pup who had been sacrificed had returned, blessed with powers beyond comprehension. The prophecy had been fulfilled in ways none could have imagined.

A new era was dawning for the Moonrunners.

---

## Season 3: Nogard's Rising

Just over three years had passed since the death of Kalanant. Life had seemingly returned to normal. Tribes began to squabble, pups roamed Primordia in safety, and the forests were teeming with life.

Nogard was given another chance at life, but she was still haunted by memories of the night of her murder. An altar... Red robes... A dagger shining in the moonlight. She couldn't describe what it felt like being reborn. Death and rebirth happened instantly for her.

---

Her parents hovered over her constantly, feeling a deep sense of guilt for her initial kidnapping. Nogard would often disappear into the forest for hours trying desperately to remember who took her that horrific night.

Nogard knew about the prophecy but didn't understand her role in it all. The council insisted that she was the prophesized leader that would protect the Moonrunners from evil. But Nogard didn't know what to believe and whom to trust.

---

After the death of Kalanant, the Dragon Cult vanished from the mountain, leaving everything behind. The Tribes explored every corner but could never find an entrance other than the bloodied stone door.

As time went on Nogard spent more and more time in the mountain trying to make sense of the Dragon Cult and why they sacrificed her.

---

Some nights, sitting atop the mountain, staring into the valley below, Nogard would see bright objects flitting through the sky. But always disappearing as they grew closer to Carouza. Her best friend Aulus who sometimes joined her could never see the lights Nogard spoke of.

Aulus noticed that Nogard was lacking a sense of purpose and that her nightmares were getting worse. Worried about her wellbeing, he went to the high council and asked them to step in.

---

Dismayed by the news that Aulus brought before them, the council knew it was time to speak to Nogard. Nogard hated the council for trying to control her life and keep her out of trouble.

The Moonspeakers had spent the last three years interpreting the prophecy and agreed that Nogard had to go through a period of development translated to "The Challenges" in wolven speech.

---

Nogard stood before the leaders of each Tribe at the high council confused and slightly irritated. The Speaker looked around the room, first to the Moonspeakers, and then to Nogard and uttered a few simple words that would forever change Nogard's life.

"You are to embark upon a series of challenges that will either make you a worthy leader, or kill you in the process." Nogard, unsure if the Speaker was serious, began to smile. The Speaker stared blankly at her until the smile fell away.

---

No longer sharing a common enemy and a strong leader to bind them, infighting between the Tribes began to spread. The prophecy believed that Nogard would be the uniting force to usher in an age of prosperity for the Moonrunners.

Nogard, dismayed by the challenges she faced, began to battle with her destiny. She wanted a brighter future for Primordia, but feared dying a second time.

---

The council introduced Nogard to Ezekiel, a Moonspeaker that volunteered to mentor her. Ezekiel was tall, dark-skinned, with a blue streak through his black hair. Nogard was relieved to know she wouldn't be alone through The Challenges.

The first challenge put to Nogard was to retrieve a rare flower known as Silphium from the Xendra valley. Nogard, excited at the apparent ease of the task, was quickly informed by Ezekiel that the flower was at the furthest edge of Primordia.

---

Ezekiel had given Nogard a map showing her how to reach Xendra. Nogard assumed she would be coming but soon realized she would have to face these challenges herself. Not even Aulus could come.

Nogard said farewell to her family, Ezekiel, and Aulus. She set out at first light and packed rations for a week-long journey.

---

A few days later Nogard reached Xendra only to realize that the flower grew at the very top of the enormous cliff-face flanking the valley. She sat at the bottom staring up in amazement at the task she faced.

Two days sooner than expected, Nogard returned to the council laden with a bag full of Silphium, and dropped it on the floor at their feet. The council, shocked, congratulated Nogard and told her to save one flower for her darkest moment.

---

A test of strength was needed to prove that Nogard had the physical ability to protect the Moonrunners in times of war. It was suggested by Andarax, The Speaker, that Nogard must remove all the boulders blocking the mountain passageways.

Nogard jumped at the opportunity to inspect the Dragon Cult's Den more closely, and sprinted out of the council room.

---

Nogard worked for days, as if possessed, never stopping and never asking for help. Every boulder she rolled down the mountain brought her one step closer to knowing the truth about the people that murdered her.

As word spread about Nogard's challenges curious Moonrunners sat in the valley below watching the boulders come streaming down the mountain. For four days the stones fell, until silence.

---

Dripping in blood from cuts, and panting from exhaustion, Nogard finally made it to the Dragon Cult chamber door, the only known entrance to their lair. She made a feeble attempt to pry the door loose before collapsing.

Concerned about the silence from the mountain, Aulus went to check on Nogard, only to see her motionless body beside the bloodsoaked door.

---

Once Aulus explained where she was and why, a fire lit in her eyes. Nogard charged at the giant stone door and at the last moment arched her shoulder and crashed through, sending a shockwave through the mountain.

Aulus peered through the entrance to see if Nogard was alive. Once he saw her giggling on the ground, he began to stare at all the wall paintings, symbols, and scrolls that littered the room.

---

The room was caked in dust, clearly being abandoned after the death of Kalanant. In the centre was a round table made from dragon bones and topped with an obsidian slab.

Thoughts raced through Nogard's mind, trying to piece together everything she saw, with all she knew. There were enormous wall paintings filled with creatures she couldn't recognize, and names that meant nothing to her.

---

From the first, darkest dawn, forged in hellfire, teeming with demon spawn

A demon unlike the rest, barrel chested, it rose above the horizon's crest

The weak slunk away towards the interior, forever tormented, for they were inferior

Ages past, and their memory was lost, but even victory in war comes at a cost

For millennia they battled until few remained, their magic and lifeblood eventually drained

A prophecy kept safe by a chosen few, an impossible decision, they wish they never knew

---

Andarax said she must stay alone in the cave for a week to be at peace with her thoughts. Aulus, visibly concerned for her wellbeing, meekly nudged forward a week's worth of rations before leaving.

Tribal leaders, hearing of Nogard's past struggles, were concerned that she was still too unstable mentally to lead the Moonrunners. They needed her to face her demons.

---

After completing her mental challenge, Nogard emerged from the cave transformed. The week of solitude had given her clarity and purpose.

She addressed the council with newfound confidence, declaring her readiness to lead the Moonrunners into a new age.

---

The final challenges tested Nogard's leadership abilities. She had to unite wolves from different tribes, resolve disputes, and prove she could make difficult decisions.

Word of her accomplishments spread throughout Primordia, and even the most skeptical elders began to see her potential.

---

But darkness still lurked in the shadows. Red-cloaked figures had been spotted near the abandoned settlements, remnants of the Dragon Cult that had never truly disappeared.

Nogard knew that her ultimate challenge was still ahead - confronting those who had sacrificed her and uncovering the truth behind the prophecy.

---

With her training complete, Nogard stood before the assembled tribes. The wolves who had once doubted her now looked upon her with respect and hope.

She raised her voice, calling for unity and vigilance. The Moonrunners had faced humans, dragons, and their own internal strife. Whatever came next, they would face it together.

---

The platoon formed behind Nogard as she led them toward the abandoned human settlements. It was time to uncover the secrets that had haunted her since her rebirth.

The Dragon Cult's true purpose, the meaning of the prophecy, and Nogard's ultimate destiny awaited in the shadows.

---

Among the ruins, they found a survivor - a prisoner of the cult who held answers to questions that had plagued the Moonrunners for years.

As Nogard approached, she felt a strange connection to this place, as if the answers she sought were finally within reach.

---

The story of Nogard's Rising continues...

As the leader of the Moonrunners, Nogard must now navigate the complex politics of the tribes while preparing for threats yet to come.

The prophecy spoke of a chosen one who would protect the pack. Nogard had risen to meet that destiny, but her journey was far from over.

---

## Season 4: Demons in the Night

Eyes darted around the crowd as nobody dared to approach the shining object. The toad crowned wolves muttered that it was the work of the toad god Crombombulus - Nogard rolled her eyes, sighing. The whirring of the engine slowly subsided before it finally died a sputtering death.

Insects trilled in the newfound silence as all eyes watched Nogard edge her way closer to what could only have been the door. Although the bravest, Nogard was still terrified of what she might unleash.

Just as her snout reached the door, vapor hissed out between its edges before the door detached and awkwardly clanked to the floor. Everyone in the crowd suddenly backed away at the shrill sound. Smoke flooded through the door, enveloping their paws.

The Moonrunners leaned forward, eyes squinting, as a figure fell through the door. Synchronized, they all gasped, eyes widening, hackles rising. The toads jumped off in fright before switching their attention to the insects fluttering about.

To their horror, an emaciated wolf had fallen out from the ship's door and onto the ground before them. Half their snout had been completely crushed and blood poured in torrents from their mouth, pooling at Nogard's feet.

---

Lurching forward, eyes searching for the leader, the wolf began to speak. Their words, garbled by the blood foaming in their mouth, dripped out in pained agony. Nogard understood they had uttered a dying plea, but was unsure of its meaning.

Fanderay ran forward in time for the wolf to die in her arms. Eyes tearing, she looked up at Nogard, as if she had to fix the problem. The manacled prisoner slowly hobbled back to his cell with a wry smile on his face.

Nogard finally saw an opportunity to get answers about Moonrunner origins and immediately ordered her top scientists to replicate the spaceship to the best of their abilities. The Wizard Robed Moonrunners surrounded the ship, opening their alchemy kits, and began frantically taking notes.

The crowd started to disperse while Nogard sat watching the Wizard Robed Moonrunners chew on their pencils with perplexed faces staring at the ship. Her and Aulus stared up at the sky, then to each other, nodding in unison.

---

The Wizard Robed Moonrunners managed to replicate the ship's technology, and with the help of Trippy Gang's eye for design, finished a fleet of twenty ships within six months.

Nogard, still haunted by the alien wolf, trained her Moonrunners to near-death in preparation for what they might face. Ezekiel led the training program alongside Burner, who still had the most combat experience on Primordia.

Ezekiel and Burner built up a friendship over the months of training, both battle-scarred, and eager to see Primordia flourish. Ezekiel, initially wary of Burner's relationship with Andarax, grew to cherish that friendship.

When the time finally came for Nogard to depart to Carouza with her war tribes, Ezekiel and Fanderay had been put in charge. Burner had been forced to stay behind to protect Primordia in the event of an invasion.

---

Burner was furious he was overlooked for the journey to Carouza. Nobody had his leadership or battle experience. Nogard insisted it was to protect Primordia, but in truth, she despised the idea of being stuck on a ship with Burner.

Ezekiel pitied Burner's fate, caught between duty and adventure, but agreed that his experience was needed on Primordia. Ezekiel promised to support Burner in the event of a surprise attack.

Burner looked to Ezekiel for support but received none, for he knew Nogard would remain irrationally obstinate. Burner glared at Ezekiel with a look of betrayal and the fire of a thousand suns for how he had been spurned and promised retribution.

---

A date was set by Nogard to begin the journey. She spent many sleepless nights deliberating when to depart. Hundreds of families and well wishers gathered to bid them farewell on their odyssey.

Thousands of Moonrunners hurriedly boarded twenty brand new ships. Moonrunners from every tribe united to avenge their fallen kin, and find answers. Andarax scoffed at Nogard's childish games for truth. Primordia, he argued, was all that mattered.

The ships' engines whirred as they slowly lifted off the ground to a cacophony of howls from the crowd. Nogard stood at the glass window watching her planet. She stood with her back to her crew for an hour, before turning away from the only planet she'd ever known.

As soon as they left their atmosphere the kaleidoscopic beauty of the galaxy before them unveiled itself. Nogard couldn't process its vastness. Overwhelmed, she became disoriented and lost sight of Carouza.

---

Finally finding the correct rune to put her back on course she pushed the ship's SI Jumper and blasted towards Carouza. Despite the speed, it took her Moonrunners almost two weeks before they reached the Carouzan orbit.

As they began to descend through the Carouzan atmosphere, cities resembling humankind began to appear beneath them. Their ansible, taken from the alien ship, began to beep frantically.

They managed to safely steer the ship into landing. A moonrunner, for the first time in their history, was on another planet.

Nogard told her ships to arm themselves, reluctant to trust humans and their warring ways.

---

They were greeted by the humans with undulating cheers. It reminded them of a time of peace between wolves and humankind. Aulus and Nogard disembarked and were greeted by Nico Lev, their leader.

The leader was clearly concerned by the wolves wearing vampire capes but decided it was best to not ask questions lest they decide to bite her. She ushered the Primordian delegation into the human headquarters.

---

The style of Carouzan settlements had few similarities to humans' on Primordia which puzzled Aulus deeply. He wondered how two cultures of the same species might have diverged so much.

Nico Lev could sense Aulus' confusion and explained that while their ancestors had probably come from the same galaxy, they had lost contact millenia ago. Nogard listened intently, her mind buzzing with questions.

At the first opportunity Nogard interjected and asked about the fate of the wolves on Carouza. Nico Lev hung her head despondently, realizing how little they knew about the tragedy that had befallen their kind.

Harkless. One word that seemed to stretch for eternity, ending in oblivion. The moonrunners were unsure how to react, wondering the possible meanings of such a word. She looked up once more "They killed them all…"

---

Nogard fought to fathom her words, struggling to comprehend what could have possibly wiped out her kin. Nico Lev began to recount the history of wolves and humans on Carouza, and to explain the presence of Harkless.

What Nico Lev described sounded like pure fantasy, or rather, horror. Four arms, chitinous skin with trees, mushrooms, and flora spawn growing over their bodies, making them essentially invisible in forests.

Nothing was understood of their culture or origins on Carouza. Nico Lev explained how they avoided humankind, usually fleeing on sight, but sought out wolves with unbridled bloodlust and savagery.

Nico Lev explained that very few wolves still existed, with most being hunted to extinction. Her moonrunners began to tremble at what Nico Lev described. Nogard too felt her heart turn to ice.

---

Nogard gathered her Moonrunner army and decided to set up camp outside the dense forest, wary of falling into a trap. She organized a scouting party with Aulus and six of her best from each tribe.

Ninja and Dragon Skull Moonrunners were assigned to the fore with Nogard and Aulus in the middle acting as the brains of the operation. As they delved further into the mystic forest they could feel a visceral tingling pain.

Their mission dragged on for days, with few sleeping, ever cautious of the Harkless lurking in the shadows. As they penetrated its depths a cacophony of life, filled with scurrying, alien fauna surrounded them.

Two weeks had passed and there was still no sign of the Harkless or any surviving wolves. Nogard began to lose hope of finding answers. Vined bones of long-dead wolves littered the forest floor.

---

Deep into the forest's heart Aulus spotted what looked like a temple. He pointed his snout in its direction while whispering to Nogard. The other fighters stopped immediately, sensing how quiet the forest had become.

On Primordia, Burner had isolated himself in an abandoned human settlement, refusing to fulfill his role as protector, assigned by Nogard. Ezekiel beseeched him to stop his sulking and rejoin his old friend to keep Primordia safe.

---

Burner ignored Ezekiel, his old friend, and only sought counsel from Andarax. Andarax was delighted by Nogard's absence and began to envision plans of supreme power. He convinced Burner he would rule the planet with his trusted guidance.

Burner's seething hatred of Nogard and Andarax's casuistry created the perfect storm. On a still autumn night, as the moon crowned the night, a silent coup had spread like a cancer and unmarked graves were dug.

Andarax gathered his cronies while Burner prepared his arsenal. It started with two moonrunners guarding the Great Hall entrance and ended with over thirty dead and buried before sunrise.

---

Ezekiel was ripped out of his bed, beaten to a pulp, and thrown into an oubliette beneath the Great Hall. Fanderay too, despite living far from the Great Hall, was also captured picking Silphium almost a week later.

In as little as a week, Primordia had become a junta puppeted by Andarax. He had set Burner up as supreme leader, and, in the event of Nogard's return, put a warrant out for her arrest and execution for abandoning the Moonrunners.

---

There were close to seventy wolves chained up with Aulus, demented and insane from years of mental and physical torture. Aulus was glad they too were chained up, fearing for his life if they were let loose.

He noticed some of the other wolves glowed as if imbued by magic while others had additional limbs or were twice his size. Those that glowed always had a tree in front of them at night, that appeared from the cracks in the ground.

Nogard and her fighters stared in horror at the tortured wolves, many turning away in shame at the conditions of their imprisonment. Nogard scanned the filthy room in search of Aulus, spotting him in the distance, barely conscious.

Without thinking, Nogard ran straight for Aulus. She noticed the corpse of another wolf beside Aulus that had enormous iron spikes along its spine. Aulus awoke at the sight of Nogard and smiled with the little energy he still had.

---

The other Carouzan wolves still chained to the wall began howling in confusion and yelping at the top of their lungs as Nogard managed to solve the puzzle lock attached to Aulus' manacles. Nogard's fighters began frantically releasing the other chained wolves once the code was solved.

As Aulus came to, he saw the other wolves being freed and screamed to Nogard to tell them to stop before it was too late. Nogard, unable to hear Aulus over the clamor, reassured him that everything was fine and he would be home safe soon.

Within seconds of the other wolves being released, mayhem began. The Carouzan wolves, insane from endless torture turned on their liberators, tearing them limb from limb.

Wolves with magical abilities that Nogard had never thought possible were unleashed on her fighters, who stood no chance. Wolves twice their size, some with laser-eyes, ice spikes, and multiple heads, attacked everything that moved.

---

Nogard began to glow purple, power coruscating through her as violence raged all around. Aulus, finally freed, limped towards the door to escape the chaos while Nogard kept their path clear.

She came face to face with a wolf three times her size blocking the exit and without hesitating, charged directly into its torso. Her purple glow turning almost to fire, blasted through the behemoth in an explosion of flesh and fur.

Aulus noticed that Nogard carried with her the cube he tried to take before falling into the trap. He noticed the same markings on the cube that were etched into the wall above each of the prisoners and wondered its significance.

Whatever it was, it was clearly highly prized by the Harkless. Nogard had completely forgotten that she was equipped with the cube in the frenzy. Now that they were escaping she thought it best not to waste its potential power.

---

She handed the cube to a trusted Moonrunner, Picar, who had also survived the onslaught along with a handful of others that were badly wounded. Strangely, no Harkless seemed to be chasing them in the temple.

Nogard and her survivors ran past the shrine to Crombombulus, the amphibian god, and out into the open. Nogard almost breathed a sigh of relief until she saw her reserves encircled by a wall of Harkless and fire.

Believing the Harkless feared fire, she ordered her troops to charge and attack before they burned themselves alive in their collapsing ring of fire. Glowing bright purple, her and the survivors, hanging on by a thread, charged the Harkless treeline.

More chaos ensued as the Harkless robotically began hacking and slicing at everything in sight. Many on the outer edge were annihilated immediately. Nogard yelled FIRE at the top of her lungs.

---

In unison, while the Harkless were busy maiming and obliterating the outer rim, a sky of fire fell upon them. The Harkless screeched so loudly the Moonrunners cowered in pain, paws on ears.

The alien creatures began to retreat into the earth and forest creating an opening for Nogard and her Moonrunners to escape before the fires were stifled. Many of the dead were left behind on the battlefield during the panicked retreat.

When they had finally arrived back at the camp Nico Lev was stunned. She couldn't believe they had actually survived the blast. She hesitantly asked if they had used the Magic Cube. Nogard had told her there was no opportunity to test its powers in the fighting.

Nico Lev chuckled and told Nogard to keep it anyway, to take it back to Primordia and use it there instead. Nogard agreed, thankful she would gift such a rare item to her planet.

---

A few days were spent tending to the wounded before the Moonrunners boarded their ships to return home. Unlike their arrival, there were no humans in sight when they finally departed except for Nico Lev and four top generals.

Nogard was sure it was out of respect and said her goodbyes to the humans who looked disappointed at their departure. Nogard envisioned one day that the two species could live side by side once more as she boarded the ship and sealed the airlock.

The weary faces of Nogard's companions weighed on her conscience. Had she done the right thing, leaving Primordia? Nogard wondered how her home planet had fared since their departure for Carouza.

In a moment of weakness she considered praying to Crombombulus upon seeing his followers, silent in meditation as their frogs and toads stared blankly ahead. It was a grueling two weeks, spent completely in her head.

---

As the ship prepared to lower its heavy belly on Primordia's soil, Picar, the scientist that had been entrusted with the Magic Cube had fallen asleep, with the cube sitting peacefully on his workbench.

Two weeks Picar had spent poring over the markings on the cube trying to decipher their meaning. He was certain he'd seen them somewhere in the temple but couldn't remember where in the frenzied melee.

The heavy thud of the ship lowering itself onto Primordian soil startled Picar from his sleep. He stared at the cube in front of him suddenly light up and open itself, as if possessed.

With one huge inhale of pure fear Picar watched as the cube armed itself and began to beep frantically. Picar's superiors in the lab, one with an eyepatch due to some mishandled chemical substance, watched on in a mix of confusion and horror.

---

The moment it began to levitate Picar started hyperventilating. He was overwhelmed with terror as the magical cube seemed to have a life of its own. All he could do was close his eyes as he went numb from fear.

When he finished howling and opened his eyes, everything was deathly silent and black. Nobody moved, frozen in time and space. Two thoughts crossed his mind, whether he himself had died and was in the afterlife or if he had accidentally killed everyone on Primordia.

He shifted his gaze to the blinking cube with a perplexed look in his eyes as a panel had appeared exposing a countdown timer with 12 hours left. In a flash of panic Picar realized he must have accidentally armed what could only be a bomb.

There was a number pad below that he surmised was the only way he could disarm the cube. He still had no idea what the symbols meant but knew that the fate of Primordia was in his shaking paws.

---

The timer's gears rotated mechanically every minute Picar failed to find an answer. The sound drove Picar mad with anxiety as he struggled to compose himself. At first he tried inputting random numbers but after the ninth guess a red box appeared around the panel, blinking a warning to him.

He couldn't leave the tiny vacuum bubble that had been created by the armed bomb to go in search of answers. He thought back to the temple, where he first saw the bomb and its strange symbols.

His time trapped in the temple was a delirious haze, but there were moments of clarity before his capture. He tried desperately to remember all he saw, hoping there would be a clue somewhere along the way.

Panic addled his thoughts so he began to meditate as if he was Crombombulus himself, ever present, and pensive. Slowly but surely, calm washed over him and a solution began to manifest itself from the recesses of his mind.

---

At last, after rechecking the total over with Magi, he inputted 211811 into the cube and closed his eyes. A high pitched sound and an implosion of air sucked Picar towards the cube.

His lab companion saw him vanish and reappear immediately in a new position with the cube beneath him. She had no idea what she just saw and shook her head in confusion as if she had imagined the whole thing.

Picar, dripping in sweat and panting, stared at her and feebly smiled. He debated whether or not to tell her what happened and that he had almost killed everyone. His eyes searched the room for an answer as she stared at him perplexed.

---

The council set up by Andarax on Primordia after the disappearance of Burner had unsurprisingly turned out to be an utter farce, a single tilt of Andarax's head could dictate who could live and who had to die.

A few brave Moonrunners, wearing hoodies to conceal their identities, tried to oppose his unconditional rule. Now, their bodies lay buried deep under Primordia's bloodied soil. His spies had their tentacles everywhere.

After the failed coup, Andarax managed to dismantle the council altogether. The more unrestrained his power, the more he grew paranoid of being deprived of it.

Primordia had become a dystopia with Andarax as king. Wolves abandoned their tribes to find safety in Primordia's furthest corners. Viewing them as deserters he put bounties on their heads.

---

Burner, helpless against Andarax, could do nothing but hide in the face of such atrocities. Guilt and shame burned a hole in his heart to the point he prepared to take his own life.

Completely alone on Primordia he prayed for an end to his torment and for Nogard's return. He scaled the top of the Dragon's mountain unseen, braving its bitter winds, and sat stoically, watching the sunset over Primordia.

Nogard and Aulus had finally found him and edged closer to capture Burner for high treason. They stopped in their tracks as they saw him stand up and walk straight towards the edge of the precipice.

Burner had one foot over before Aulus called out for him to stop. Burner, frightened, mid-step, slipped and fell over the ledge, dangling by his paws. Nogard hesitated, wondering whether to intervene.

---

Burner wasn't sure why he held on to that ledge, as rocks plummeted all around him. How freeing it must feel to be that rock, weightless, and inert for eternity. Just as he began to relax his paws, Nogard bit down on his scruff and pulled him to safety.

Aulus wasn't sure if he should attack Burner or console him. Survivors of their nefarious reign had told them he was the reason Moonrunner society had devolved into a dystopia. Burner hung his head in shame and wondered when he would finally be free of his guilt.

Nogard, still cautious of Burner and all the horrific stories she had heard, waited patiently until he began to explain himself. Burner, clearly disappointed he was still alive began to explain what happened.

Nogard listened without emotion, as Burner explained the mass executions. He claimed he had only followed orders but knew their blood was on his hands. Nogard's face turned to disgust, and then pity as she noticed the remorse in his eyes.

---

Burner didn't even notice her pity, painfully insignificant to how much he pitied himself. His feeling of abandonment and regret was palpable as his dirge came to a somber close.

Abandoned on Primordia and tricked by Andarax, he had lost everything. The weight of his mistakes, Nogard realized, had led him to this cliff. Aulus turned away muttering to Nogard to leave the wretch to his own fate.

As Nogard slowly turned away she saw Burner break his semblance of composure and begin to weep quietly, being abandoned a final time before his end. Nogard stopped still a few steps after turning away to follow Aulus.

"Well, are you coming or not…we need your help to find this cockroach" she said as if forced, showing no emotion whatsoever. Burner, head down, raised his eyes, tears running down his snout. He looked back to the edge once more before following Nogard down the mountain.

---

Andarax had been waiting for them in the Great Hall after his spies informed him their ship had landed. Nogard's Army marched to the Great Hall in a state of confusion and fear.

Pennants of Andarax flailed wildly in the wind as they marched to the giant oaken doors of the Great Hall. Nogard flung the door open to see Andarax snarling, alone atop his throne of bones.

His eyes pierced Nogard's confidence, who let out a gasp upon seeing Fanderay lying unconscious on the floor like a broken doll. Andarax's foot was resting triumphantly on her neck as a hunter over their prey.

Nogard demanded Andarax to release what was left of Fanderay. In return, she promised, they would have him confined for life, rather than executed for high treason.

---

Andarax, realizing his options were quickly slipping away, began to articulate a reply when Fanderay stirred on the floor, and uttered something incomprehensible. Her throat bruised from the iron collar.

Her bruised eyes reflected the light from the sconces hanging on the walls when Nogard motioned towards her almost unconsciously to help. Fearing an attack, or worse, the truth, Andarax cut her throat immediately.

Fanderay, still in a delirium, felt her face warm with blood as it spurted out of her opened throat. Nogard froze, shocked. Her panic made her completely lose focus of Andarax's whereabouts.

She didn't realize until it was too late that Andarax was dangerously close to stabbing her too, a flashing murderous glint in his eyes. Burner, seeing his salvation, launched himself in the path of the knife, stabbing him directly in the chest.

---

Andarax, furious that Burner had ruined his final chance at vanquishing Nogard spat on his body as it writhed pitifully at his feet. The smile on Burner's face slowly faded as the crimson pool enveloped him.

Andarax called out to his spies frantically, but only silence answered. He growled at Nogard before fleeing the hall through a secret exit he had built in his paranoia. To the others it seemed as though he simply vanished.

Nogard was catatonic, which life should she rush to save, her friend or her savior? Tears welled up in her eyes as her legs began to quiver at the decision. Just as she motioned towards Fanderay, Aulus pulled her back.

Both had died. Their blood coalesced at Nogard's feet, as their hollow eyes stared at her as though they wore a macabre death mask. Nogard pushed Aulus away and ensconced herself in Fanderay's corpse.

---

Aulus, unsure what to do, reminded Nogard that Andarax had escaped. Nogard's sadness turned to anger as she heard that demon's name. She arose gently, as if Fanderay was simply sleeping.

As soon as she was upright she glowed a fiery purple and charged out of the room in search of Andarax. Her senses were heightened as she hunted his spoor. She broke in and out of rooms, smashing down doors until she reached the dungeons.

Crossing the threshold, she could immediately feel Andarax's presence. The dungeon was unrecognizable, corpses cluttering the cells, and crates of supplies littering the halls. Torture devices she couldn't fathom still dripped blood onto the soaked cobblestones.

She slowed down and treaded silently through the squalor, lest she walk into a trap. She could sense magic surrounding her as she had experienced on Carouza. What nefarious experiments had Andarax been conducting down here?

---

The final door at the end of the hall stood ajar with kaleidoscopic lights glowing within. Nogard was certain Andarax was there as she began to hear the clinking of beakers and the shuffling papers.

Nogard nudged the door open to see Andarax unaware of her presence and frantically packing away supplies into a large backpack. Eyes on Andarax, Nogard overlooked the broken glass at her feet. She winced at the pain and caught Andarax's wide eyes.

Andarax, in a panic, dropped his bag and jumped into an open oubliette. Nogard scoffed at the foolish move and went to close the latch until she peered in to see it completely empty.

Nogard growled at Andarax's endless scheming and failsafes. The image of Fanderay's corpse was seared into her mind, and as long as her memory persisted she would seek vengeance.

---

Nogard lifted her gaze from the empty cell and began to wander around the lab. The smell of potions covered in ancient runes and vats labeled Dragonblood stupefied her. She moved to inspect Andarax's bag.

Hundreds of diagrams and schematics of scientific equipment, marginalia covered with human handwriting. Nogard couldn't make sense of it. Huge vats with what looked like eggs resting within.

That's when she saw them, the dragon eggs, far larger than she remembered, resting peacefully within a heated incubator. Nogard was furious they'd been removed from the chest and experimented upon.

Nogard moved closer until her snout pressed against the glass. She squinted, peering through the warped tank, trying to make out what lay behind the two giant incubators.

The machines seemed to be fuelled by Dragonblood, which she simply couldn't comprehend. She edged her way around the two behemoths and that's when she saw the unthinkable. An endless row of incubators, thousands of them, engines softly humming.
