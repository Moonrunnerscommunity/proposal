# The Ledger

The magic system is **the Ledger** — an immutable record that tracks everything. Stats. Levels. Skills. Deaths. Resurrections. Every achievement, every failure, permanently inscribed.

## The Minted

Wolves connected to the Ledger. They see their stats, feel their growth, know exactly where they stand. When they die, the Ledger remembers them. They can resurrect (with costs).

## The Unminted

Everyone else. The Ledger doesn't see them. They live, die, and are forgotten. No stats. No levels. No resurrection. Just... gone.

## Moonspeakers

The only beings who can Mint wolves — give them access to the Ledger. After Minting, the wolf starts at Level 1. Everything from there is earned.
