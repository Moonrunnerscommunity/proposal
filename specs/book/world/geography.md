# Primordia Geography

Primordia is a fragment of a shattered world drifting in the Void Between.

## Major Locations

**The Six Territories:** One per tribe (Hunter, Predator, Pack, Stealth, Roaming, Brave)

**The Spire:** Minted aristocracy stronghold at the center

**The Edges:** Where the fragment ends — you can see the Void

**The Dragonhorde Peaks:** Dragons, mostly neutral, their own agenda

**The Deep Warrens:** Something older lives below

## Beyond Primordia

**Other Fragments:** Exist. Reachable through moon-gates. Future expansion.

**The Moons:** Not celestial bodies. Something else. The Ledger responds to their cycles.
