# Sample Opening

> The last meeting I ever attended was sprint planning.
>
> I don't remember what we were planning. Something about Q3. Velocity. Story points. The fluorescent lights were flickering and someone was arguing about whether a bug was a one or a three.
>
> I remember thinking: *I could have built something real.*
>
> Then I felt something pull at the center of my chest — a hook I didn't know was there — and the conference room dissolved, and I woke up in a cave.
>
> Three wolves stared at me.
>
> "Uh," I said.
>
> The biggest one stepped forward. Old. Scarred. Unimpressed.
>
> "You're the Moonspeaker."
>
> "I'm the what?"
>
> "The one who will lead our revolution."
>
> I looked around the cave. Bare rock. A fire pit. Something that might have been a manifesto, scratched onto bark.
>
> "This is the revolution?"
>
> "This is the beginning."
>
> "It's three of you. In a cave."
>
> The old wolf's eyes glittered.
>
> "Four now."
