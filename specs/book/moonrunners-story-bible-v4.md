# THE WORLD

## The Ledger

The magic system is **the Ledger** — an immutable record that tracks everything. Stats. Levels. Skills. Deaths. Resurrections. Every achievement, every failure, permanently inscribed.

**The Minted:** Wolves connected to the Ledger. They see their stats, feel their growth, know exactly where they stand. When they die, the Ledger remembers them. They can resurrect (with costs).

**The Unminted:** Everyone else. The Ledger doesn't see them. They live, die, and are forgotten. No stats. No levels. No resurrection. Just... gone.

**Moonspeakers:** The only beings who can Mint wolves — give them access to the Ledger. After Minting, the wolf starts at Level 1. Everything from there is earned.

**Terminology:**
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Minted | Connected to the Ledger, has levels |
| Unminted | No Ledger access, invisible to the system |
| Getting Minted | Being Awakened by a Moonspeaker |
| Diamond wolves | Strong bonds, loyal, long holders |
| Paper wolves | Weak bonds, traitors, quick to flip |
| Gas | Energy cost of Minting |
| The Burn | Permanent sacrifice for power |
| Rugged | Betrayed (what Andarax did) |
| The Merge | When all six Moonspeakers unite (theoretical) |

## Primordia Geography

Primordia is a fragment of a shattered world drifting in the Void Between.

**The Six Territories:** One per tribe (Hunter, Predator, Pack, Stealth, Roaming, Brave)
**The Spire:** Minted aristocracy stronghold at the center
**The Edges:** Where the fragment ends — you can see the Void
**The Dragonhorde Peaks:** Dragons, mostly neutral, their own agenda
**The Deep Warrens:** Something older lives below

**Other Fragments:** Exist. Reachable through moon-gates. Future expansion.

**The Moons:** Not celestial bodies. Something else. The Ledger responds to their cycles.

---

## The Factions

| Faction | Belief | Moonspeaker Stance |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| **The Minted** | The Ledger chose us. Birthright. | Kill them immediately |
| **The Unminted** | We deserve access too | Our salvation |
| **The Choir** | Everyone should be Minted | Protect and assist |
| **The Hollow** | The Ledger is corruption | Destroy them AND the Minted |
| **The Keepers** | Balance above all | Use carefully, if at all |

# THE PROTAGONIST

## Monica Lansky, 31

**The Name Bit:**
On Earth: "Like... Monica Lewinsky?" "Lansky. LANS-ky. Different person. Different scandal."

In Primordia: She introduces herself. Nothing. The wolves have no context. She nearly cries with relief.

Then TJ: "Wait. Monica Lansky? Like Monica Lewin—"

"I will end you."

---

## Earth Life

**Job:** Global VP of Performance Marketing at Omnicom

Executive level. Hundreds of millions in ad spend. Her specialty: programmatic advertising and behavioral targeting. She knows how to make people want things they didn't know they wanted.

In advertising, this is called "strategy."
In revolution, it's called "propaganda."

**The Success:**
She's phenomenally successful. Promoted repeatedly. Award-winning campaigns. Corner office. Presents to boards without flinching. Manages crises without breaking a sweat.

She's not lacking conventional courage. She's braver than most people.

**The Problem:**
She's a professional liar.

Not villainously. Professionally. Her entire career is crafting personas, manufacturing desire, making people believe things. She's brilliant at it.

But she's been doing it so long she doesn't know what's real anymore. Including herself.

---

## Her Actual Wound

**What she doesn't have:**
- Genuine beliefs (she believes whatever the client needs)
- Authentic relationships (people are audiences to manage)
- A real identity (she's optimized herself into a performance)
- Real stakes (if a campaign fails, she loses money — nobody dies)

She's never had to actually BE something. She just has to make people THINK she is.

**The Thing She Never Did:**
Her college roommate asked her to co-found a startup. Monica said no. Took the safe corporate path. Watched the roommate sell for eight figures.

But deeper: she said no because she didn't believe in it. She doesn't believe in anything. She just sells things.

---

## Her Arc

**From:** "I can sell anything, including myself."
**To:** "I have to actually BE something worth believing in."

The propaganda subplot gains depth: she CAN make the revolution spread. But the wolves notice she doesn't seem to... believe in it. She's running it like a campaign. Professional. Effective. Empty.

You can't lead a revolution you don't believe in. You can't inspire people to die for something you're just "optimizing."

She has to discover what she actually believes. What she'd actually die for. Who she actually is when she stops performing.

---

## Why Brave Tribe Is Perfect (And Terrible)

Brave tribe isn't about physical courage. Any idiot can jump off a cliff.

Brave tribe is about **authenticity under pressure.**

When everything's on the line, who are you REALLY? Not the persona. Not the optimized version. The raw, unfiltered, terrifying truth.

Brave wolves can *sense* inauthenticity. They're frontline warriors — they need to trust the wolf beside them is REAL. A fake gets the pack killed.

Every time Monica tries to "perform" bravery, they call her out:

> Kael: "You're doing it again."
> 
> Monica: "Doing what?"
> 
> Kael: "The face. The voice. Whatever you do when you want people to think something."
> 
> Monica: "That's called communication."
> 
> Kael: "That's called lying. We can tell."

---

## The Bond

Monica is bonded to **Wolf #7,777** — one of the original 10k. That wolf died 900 years ago, but the bond persists. She carries echoes: dreams, impulses, fragments of memory.

**The Wolf: Sable of the Brave**
In the chaos after the Mint, Sable hit Level 40 in weeks. A legend.

She was in love with Ember, a Pack wolf. When the Moonspeakers were killed, Ember supported it. They fought. Ember killed her.

**The Complication:**
Ember's bloodline continues in the Minted aristocracy. Monica will meet a descendant with Ember's eyes. Someone carrying 900-year-old guilt in their blood.

---

## The Propaganda Subplot

Monica arrives expecting to be useless. Combat? No. Survival? No. Magic? No.

Then she watches the resistance try to recruit:

> "Your messaging is terrible."
> 
> Vex: "Our... what?"
> 
> "Your value proposition. 'Fight and probably die for a chance at freedom' — that's not converting anyone. Where's the emotional hook? The social proof?"
> 
> "I need a wall and something to write with. We're doing a full campaign audit."

**What she does:**
- Reverse-engineers the Minted's 1000-year propaganda
- Creates recruitment messaging that works
- A/B tests revolutionary slogans
- Runs actual wolf focus groups
- Presents campaign decks to confused commanders

**The punchline:** It works. Horrifyingly well. She might be the most dangerous person in the revolution because she knows how to make ideas spread.

**The dark mirror:** The Minted try to recruit her. Their propaganda is crude — enforced by power, not persuasion. She's better. The offer is tempting.

**The deeper problem:** Her propaganda works, but she doesn't believe in it. At some point, that gap becomes fatal. Once she figures out what she actually believes, she can sell it with genuine conviction. That's when she becomes truly dangerous.

# THE CREW

## Kael of the Brave (Guardian)

**Age:** 19 wolf-years

Youngest Moonguard ever selected. Not the best fighter — just the only Brave wolf who wanted the job. His family are decorated warriors. He's the disappointment.

**His wound:** Not good enough. Knows it.
**His arc:** Courage isn't just charging — it's honesty about fear.
**The forbidden:** Moonguards don't fall for Moonspeakers. First rule.
**His role with Monica:** He's the one who keeps calling out her performances. He can sense the inauthenticity. It drives them both crazy.

---

## Vex (Mentor/Evaluator)

**Age:** Old

Former Stealth spymaster. Forty years ago, her intelligence failure got 600 wolves killed. She crawled into a bottle.

**Her role:** Assigned to evaluate Monica. Report failures. Authorize severance.
**Her secret:** She saw something during the Betrayal the histories don't record.
**Her arc:** Seeking a good death. Monica gives her something worse: a reason to live.

---

## Pip (Protégé)

**Age:** 14 wolf-years

Roaming adolescent separated from her pack. Monica saved her (efficiently, not heroically). Pip decided Monica is her hero.

**The problem:** Monica is a terrible role model. Every behavior Pip copies — the emotional distance, the strategic framing, the performance — is what Monica should unlearn.
**Her gift:** Doesn't think in straight lines. The dumb obvious suggestion that works.

---

## Biscuit (Comic Relief)

**Species:** Frog

Creatures near Minted wolves develop minor Ledger-awareness. Biscuit developed opinions. Monica (only Monica) hears him.

Always critical. Always accurate. Never helpful.

> Monica, mid-speech: "We face impossible odds—"
> 
> Biscuit: *You rehearsed this in the river. Four times. The tall one isn't listening.*

---

## Grak (Chaos Agent)

**Species:** Goblin

Trader who appears wherever drama happens. Prices unfair. Information accurate.

> "Ah! The human! HAT OF MINOR INTIMIDATION. Plus two to scary. You need this. You are not scary. Grak has noticed."

---

# THE OTHER MOONSPEAKERS

| Tribe | Name | Background | Hook |
|-------|------|------------|------|
| **Brave** | Monica Lansky | Global VP Marketing, 31 | Protagonist |
| **Hunter** | Derek Moss | Construction foreman, 52 | Inherited NFT from dead son |
| **Predator** | TJ Jackson | Discord mod, 24 | Knows all the lore, thinks this is his anime moment |
| **Pack** | Ruth Oyelaran | Retired nurse, 68 | Bought matching NFTs with late wife |
| **Stealth** | Alex Reeves | Grad student, 26 | Non-binary, treating it like fieldwork |
| **Roaming** | Marcus Webb | Trust fund backpacker, 29 | Everyone assumes he's useless |

**The Traitor:** One Guardian is feeding info to the Minted. Not by choice — magical binding, family hostage. When revealed, it's tragedy, not betrayal.

---

# THE BRAVE TRIAL

## Part One: The Drop

A cliff. A fall. Water below (probably).

Monica could probably psych herself up for this. Physical courage isn't her problem.

But the drop is just the surface test.

## Part Two: The Truth Circle

After you jump, you stand before the tribe. They ask questions. Any question. You answer honestly. No spin. No framing. No "strategic transparency."

If they sense you're performing — and they will — you fail.

> "Why are you here?"
>
> Monica's instinct: *Give them the answer they want. Unity. Destiny. The cause.*
>
> What comes out: "I... don't know. I didn't choose this. I was pulled out of a meeting I didn't care about into a war I don't understand. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know if I should be."
>
> Silence.
>
> Kael: "That's the first true thing you've said since you arrived."

**What she learns:** The line between authenticity and performance. When does "act brave" become "be brave"? When does the mask become the face?

In advertising, you fake it till you make it — and keep faking. In Brave tribe, faking is valid only if you ACTUALLY make it. The performance has to become real.

# MINTING MECHANICS

## What Moonspeakers Do

They grant ACCESS, not levels.

A Moonspeaker Mints a wolf into the Ledger. That wolf starts at Level 1. Everything after is earned.

**Why this matters:** The Minted claim the Ledger is birthright. Moonspeakers prove it's a lie.

---

## Minting Prerequisites

### Moon Cycles

| Moon | Capacity |
|------|----------|
| New Moon | None |
| Half Moon | 1-3 wolves |
| Full Moon | 7-12 wolves |
| Blood Moon | 30-50 wolves (yearly) |
| Convergence | Unknown (theoretical) |

### Wolf Requirements

**Pack Witness:** Seven wolves vouch with their lives.
**The Trial:** Candidate proves worthiness.
**The Oath:** Candidate declares purpose. Becomes binding.

### Moonspeaker Requirements

| Present | Multiplier |
|---------|------------|
| 1 | Base |
| 2 | 3x |
| 3+ | Exponential |
| All 6 | Unknown |

### The Cost

**Fatigue:** Too many per cycle = collapse.
**Bond Strain:** More wolves = thinner connection.
**The Bleed:** High-volume Minting changes you.

---

# EARTH CONNECTIONS

## The Dimensional Barrier

The original Mint punched a hole between Earth and Primordia. It's been leaking for 1000 years.

**Bond Persistence:** Every original 10k wolf is still connected to their NFT holder. Even if the wolf died. Even if the holder forgot.

**Holder Effect:** Significant NFT events on Earth — sales, burns, community attention — cause bond flickers. Moonspeakers feel surges they can't explain.

---

## Ways Earth People Arrive

| Method | Who |
|--------|-----|
| **Summoning** | Holders with strong bonds (the six) |
| **Drift** | Random holders pulled accidentally |
| **Glitch** | Non-holders near holders during surges |
| **Push** | Deliberate Earth-side action |
| **Pull** | Minted experiments |

---

## Crypto Parallels (Subtle)

| Earth | Primordia |
|-------|-----------|
| Wallet connection | The Bond |
| Gas fees | Minting energy cost |
| Block confirmations | Moon cycles |
| Staking | Wolves commit to causes |
| Burning | Sacrifice for power |
| Diamond hands | Strong bonds |
| Paper hands | Traitors |
| Rugging | The Betrayal |
| The Merge | All six unite |

---

# PLOT STRUCTURE

## Book One: The Awakening

**Act One (Ch 1-8):** Monica summoned. Meets Kael, Vex, other Moonspeakers. Learns she's Brave tribe — worst match for someone whose whole life is performance. Discovers she's a weapon in a revolution she didn't sign up for.

**Act Two (Ch 9-20):** Training disaster. Keeps getting called out for performing instead of being. Builds crew. Discovers her actual skill — propaganda. First campaign. But the wolves sense she doesn't believe. The Minted send assassins.

**Act Three (Ch 21-28):** Trial approaches. The Drop she can handle. The Truth Circle terrifies her. Everything escalates — assassination, betrayal revealed, first Minting under siege. Has to be real for the first time in her life.

**Cliffhanger:** Passes. First Minting. Then: "There's something you should know about the first summoning."

---

## Series Arc

| Book | Focus | Scope |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1: The Awakening | Arrival, survival, first Minting | One territory |
| 2: The Choir | Six coordinate, war goes hot | Multiple territories |
| 3: The First Summoning | 100-year mystery revealed | Primordia-wide |
| 4: The Fragments | Other shards, civilizations | Multi-fragment |
| 5+: The Ledger | What IS it? Who wrote it? | Cosmic |

---

# THEMES

**Primary:**
- Authenticity vs. Performance — Who are you when you stop optimizing?
- Earned vs. Inherited — Power means nothing if you didn't earn it
- NPC Revolution — The background characters demand to be protagonists

**Secondary:**
- Found family under pressure
- The cost of inaction
- Who writes history?
- Propaganda and truth — where's the line?

---

# OPEN QUESTIONS

- What happened during the first summoning?
- What IS the Ledger? Who created it?
- Can Ember's descendant be redeemed?
- What's in the Deep Warrens?
- What happens when all six Moonspeakers unite?
- Who on Earth is pushing people through on purpose?

---

# SAMPLE OPENING

> The last meeting I ever attended was about Q3 projections.
>
> I don't remember what the projections were. I remember the fluorescent lights flickering, and thinking that if I had to hear "synergizing cross-functional deliverables" one more time, I was going to walk into traffic.
>
> Instead, I felt something pull at the center of my chest — a hook I didn't know was there — and the conference room dissolved, and I woke up in a circle of wolves.
>
> "Uh," I said.
>
> One wolf stepped forward. Young. Earnest.
>
> "Moonspeaker," he said, dropping to one knee. "I am Kael of the Brave. Your guardian. I pledge my life to your service."
>
> A smaller wolf behind him sighed.
>
> "Another one who doesn't read the terms of service."
>
> "Cool," I said. "Quick question. What the fuck?"
