# Monica Laminsky, 31

## The Name Bit

On Earth: "Like... Monica Lewinsky?" "Laminsky. Lam-IN-sky. Different person. Different scandal."

In Primordia: She introduces herself. Nothing. The wolves have no context. She nearly cries with relief.

Then TJ: "Wait. Monica Lansky? Like Monica Lewin—"

"I will end you."

## Earth Life

**Job:** Senior Product Manager at a Fortune 500

She ships features. She hits OKRs. She coordinates cross-functional teams. She's very, very good at building things for other people.

**The Thing She Never Did:**

Her college roommate asked her to co-found a startup. Monica said no. Took the safe corporate path. Watched the roommate build something real, something that mattered, and sell it for eight figures.

**The NFT:**

She minted it years ago and completely forgot about it. She's got some bitcoin and ethereum—not a lot—but she never bought another NFT. Couldn't tell you how to access it anymore. Doesn't even remember the password to whatever wallet she used.

It remembered her.

## Her Actual Wound

She's risk-averse. Capable but cautious. She's spent her whole life avoiding the leap—the startup, the risk, the thing that might fail spectacularly.

She's never built something that was *hers*. Always someone else's product, someone else's vision, someone else's risk.

## Her Arc

**From:** "I build things for other people."
**To:** "I'm building something that matters—and it's mine."

The revolution isn't waiting for her with an army. It's three wolves in a cave with a manifesto on bark. She has to build everything from scratch.

She's finally getting the startup she said no to.

## Why Brave Tribe

Taking the leap. Leading from the front. Charging first.

Everything Monica has spent her life avoiding.

The wolves who charge, who risk, who leap before they look—they're going to force her to become the version of herself she's always been too scared to be.

## CEO of the Revolution

She's not here to manage someone else's roadmap. She's building an organization from nothing.

- **Vision:** What does winning even look like? She has to define it.
- **Strategy:** Which fights matter, which don't, what order, what resources.
- **Hiring:** Recruiting wolves who don't trust humans, don't trust each other, and have every reason to say no.
- **Culture:** Three wolves in a cave becomes thirty becomes three hundred. How do you keep the thing from eating itself?
- **Hard calls:** Who gets Minted first when you can only Mint a few per moon? Who leads the mission that's probably a death sentence?
- **Accountability:** When it fails—and it will fail, repeatedly—it's on her.

She spent her career executing someone else's vision. Now she has to have one.
