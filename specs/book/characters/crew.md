# The Crew

## Kael of the Brave (Guardian)

**Age:** 19 wolf-years

Youngest Moonguard ever selected. Not the best fighter — just the only Brave wolf who wanted the job. His family are decorated warriors. He's the disappointment.

**His wound:** Not good enough. Knows it.

**His arc:** Courage isn't just charging — it's honesty about fear.

**The forbidden:** Moonguards don't fall for Moonspeakers. First rule.

**His role with Monica:** He's young, earnest, and desperately wants to prove himself. She's building something from nothing. They learn together.

## Vex (Mentor/Evaluator)

**Age:** Old

Former Stealth spymaster. Forty years ago, her intelligence failure got 600 wolves killed. She crawled into a bottle.

**Her role:** Assigned to evaluate Monica. Report failures. Authorize severance.

**Her secret:** She saw something during the Betrayal the histories don't record.

**Her arc:** Seeking a good death. Monica gives her something worse: a reason to live.

---

## Pip (Protégé)

**Age:** 14 wolf-years

Roaming adolescent separated from her pack. Monica saved her (efficiently, not heroically). Pip decided Monica is her hero.

**The problem:** Monica is figuring this out as she goes. Every instinct Pip copies might be wrong.

**Her gift:** Doesn't think in straight lines. The dumb obvious suggestion that works.

## Biscuit (Comic Relief)

**Species:** Frog

Creatures near Minted wolves develop minor Ledger-awareness. Biscuit developed opinions. Monica (only Monica) hears him.

Always critical. Always accurate. Never helpful.

> Monica, mid-pitch: "We can do this—"
>
> Biscuit: *The tall one stopped listening two sentences ago. Also there's a spider on your shoulder.*

## Grak (Chaos Agent)

**Species:** Goblin

Trader who appears wherever drama happens. Prices unfair. Information accurate.

> "Ah! The human! HELMET OF LOOKING COMPETENT. Plus two to first impressions. You need this. Grak has noticed you do not make good first impressions."
