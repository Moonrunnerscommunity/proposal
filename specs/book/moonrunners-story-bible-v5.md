# PART ONE: THE WORLD

## The Ledger

The magic system is **the Ledger** — an immutable record that tracks everything. Stats. Levels. Skills. Deaths. Resurrections. Every achievement, every failure, permanently inscribed.

**The Minted:** Wolves connected to the Ledger. They see their stats, feel their growth, know exactly where they stand. When they die, the Ledger remembers them. They can resurrect (with costs).

**The Unminted:** Everyone else. The Ledger doesn't see them. They live, die, and are forgotten. No stats. No levels. No resurrection. Just… gone.

**Moonspeakers:** The only beings who can Mint wolves — give them access to the Ledger. After Minting, the wolf starts at Level 1. Everything from there is earned.

---

## Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Minted | Connected to the Ledger, has levels |
| Unminted | No Ledger access, invisible to the system |
| Getting Minted | Being Awakened by a Moonspeaker |
| Diamond wolves | Strong bonds, loyal, long holders |
| Paper wolves | Weak bonds, traitors, quick to flip |
| Gas | Energy cost of Minting |
| The Burn | Permanent sacrifice for power |
| Rugged | Betrayed (what Andarax did) |
| The Merge | When all six Moonspeakers unite (theoretical) |

---

## The Timeline

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **Year 0** | The Mint — 10,000 wolves connect to the Ledger |
| **Years 0-100** | The Moonspeaker Era — Original six maintain balance, Mint sparingly |
| **~Year 100** | The Betrayal — Andarax turns, Minted use this to kill all Moonspeakers |
| **~Year 100-200** | The Problem Tribe wiped out by other Minted |
| **~Year 100** | Zeek's failed summoning attempt (900 years before present) |
| **Years 100-900** | The Long Silence — Ledger access becomes hereditary, aristocracy consolidates |
| **Year 1000** | NOW — Monica summoned by the cave crew |

---

## Wolf Lifespans

Wolves age at roughly the same rate as humans.

- **Pup:** 0-9 years
- **Small wolf:** 10-19 years (adolescence)
- **Adult wolf:** 20+ years
- **Natural lifespan:** ~70-80 years

**The Minted Exception:** Connection to the Ledger extends life. Minted wolves age slower, live longer — potentially centuries. This is part of what makes the class divide so permanent. The aristocracy doesn't just pass down wealth; they pass down TIME.

---

## Primordia Geography

Primordia is a fragment of a shattered world drifting in the Void Between.

**The Six Territories:** One per tribe (Hunter, Predator, Pack, Stealth, Roaming, Brave)

**The Spire:** Minted aristocracy stronghold at the center

**The Edges:** Where the fragment ends — you can see the Void

**The Dragonhorde Peaks:** Dragons, mostly neutral, their own agenda

**The Deep Warrens:** Something older lives below. Also where the Keepers hide their forbidden archives.

**Other Fragments:** Exist. Reachable through moon-gates. Future expansion.

**The Moons:** Not celestial bodies. Something else. The Ledger responds to their cycles.

---

## The Six Tribes

| Tribe | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Hunter** | Trackers, providers, pragmatic |
| **Predator** | Warriors, fierce, protective |
| **Pack** | Community-focused, diplomatic, connectors |
| **Stealth** | Shadow-walkers, intelligence gatherers, secretive |
| **Roaming** | Wanderers, explorers, knowledge-seekers |
| **Brave** | Frontline defenders, courageous, honor-bound |

---

## The Factions

| Faction | Belief | Moonspeaker Stance |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| **The Minted** | The Ledger chose us. Birthright. | Kill them immediately |
| **The Unminted** | We deserve access too | Our salvation |
| **The Choir** | Everyone should be Minted | Protect and assist |
| **The Hollow** | The Ledger is corruption | Destroy them AND the Minted |
| **The Keepers** | Balance above all | Use carefully, if at all |

---

## The Problem Tribe

One of the six tribes has no Minted left.

Early in the post-Betrayal era, they fought against the other Minted. Maybe they refused to go along with the purge. Maybe they tried to protect their Moonspeaker. Whatever happened, the other tribes wiped them out.

Now their descendants are all Unminted. There's no one who can serve as conduit. No way to summon their Moonspeaker.

**TBD:** Which tribe? Candidates:
- **Pack** (thematically painful — the community tribe has no community)
- **Roaming** (scattered, no homeland, fits their wanderer nature)
- NOT Brave (too convenient since Monica is Brave)

**The Problem:** How do you summon a Moonspeaker when the ritual requires a Minted conduit and none exist? This must be solved to complete the Merge.

---

# PART TWO: THE PROTAGONIST

## Monica Lansky, 31

**The Name Bit:**

On Earth: "Like… Monica Lewinsky?" "Lansky. LANS-ky. Different person. Different scandal."

In Primordia: She introduces herself. Nothing. The wolves have no context. She nearly cries with relief.

Then another human arrives later: "Wait. Monica Lansky? Like Monica Lewin—"

"I will end you."

---

## Earth Life

**Job:** Global VP of Performance Marketing at Omnicom

Executive level. Hundreds of millions in ad spend. Her specialty: programmatic advertising and behavioral targeting. She knows how to make people want things they didn't know they wanted.

In advertising, this is called "strategy."
In revolution, it's called "propaganda."

**The Success:**
She's phenomenally successful. Promoted repeatedly. Award-winning campaigns. Corner office. Presents to boards without flinching. Manages crises without breaking a sweat.

She's not lacking conventional courage. She's braver than most people.

**The Problem:**
She's a professional liar.

Not villainously. Professionally. Her entire career is crafting personas, manufacturing desire, making people believe things. She's brilliant at it.

But she's been doing it so long she doesn't know what's real anymore. Including herself.

---

## Her Actual Wound

**What she doesn't have:**
- Genuine beliefs (she believes whatever the client needs)
- Authentic relationships (people are audiences to manage)
- A real identity (she's optimized herself into a performance)
- Real stakes (if a campaign fails, she loses money — nobody dies)

She's never had to actually BE something. She just has to make people THINK she is.

**The Thing She Never Did:**
Her college roommate asked her to co-found a startup. Monica said no. Took the safe corporate path. Watched the roommate sell for eight figures.

But deeper: she said no because she didn't believe in it. She doesn't believe in anything. She just sells things.

---

## Her Arc

**From:** "I can sell anything, including myself."
**To:** "I have to actually BE something worth believing in."

The propaganda subplot gains depth: she CAN make the revolution spread. But the wolves notice she doesn't seem to… believe in it. She's running it like a campaign. Professional. Effective. Empty.

You can't lead a revolution you don't believe in. You can't inspire people to die for something you're just "optimizing."

She has to discover what she actually believes. What she'd actually die for. Who she actually is when she stops performing.

---

## Why Brave Tribe Is Perfect (And Terrible)

Brave tribe isn't about physical courage. Any idiot can jump off a cliff.

Brave tribe is about **authenticity under pressure.**

When everything's on the line, who are you REALLY? Not the persona. Not the optimized version. The raw, unfiltered, terrifying truth.

Brave wolves can *sense* inauthenticity. They're frontline warriors — they need to trust the wolf beside them is REAL. A fake gets the pack killed.

Every time Monica tries to "perform" bravery, they call her out.

---

## The Propaganda Subplot

Monica arrives expecting to be useless. Combat? No. Survival? No. Magic? No.

Then she watches the resistance try to recruit:

> "Your messaging is terrible."
>
> Sorrel: "Our… what?"
>
> "Your value proposition. 'Fight and probably die for a chance at freedom' — that's not converting anyone. Where's the emotional hook? The social proof?"
>
> "I need a wall and something to write with. We're doing a full campaign audit."

**What she does:**
- Reverse-engineers the Minted's 1000-year propaganda
- Creates recruitment messaging that works
- A/B tests revolutionary slogans
- Runs actual wolf focus groups
- Presents campaign decks to confused commanders

**The punchline:** It works. Horrifyingly well. She might be the most dangerous person in the revolution because she knows how to make ideas spread.

**The dark mirror:** The Minted try to recruit her. Their propaganda is crude — enforced by power, not persuasion. She's better. The offer is tempting.

**The deeper problem:** Her propaganda works, but she doesn't believe in it. At some point, that gap becomes fatal. Once she figures out what she actually believes, she can sell it with genuine conviction. That's when she becomes truly dangerous.

---

# PART THREE: THE CREW

## The Cave Crew

Three teenagers. Friends since childhood. They've been planning this for ten years.

**The Setup:** Ash is the son of a Brave aristocratic household. Sorrel and Pix are twins — their mother works as a servant in that same household. Kids don't care about class. They played together, became inseparable, and at some point realized the world was broken.

They swore they'd fix it. They were seven.

Now they're seventeen, and they just summoned a Moonspeaker.

---

## Ash

**Full Name:** Ashford Vorne (or Ashwick Valorin — TBD)
**Goes By:** Ash
**Age:** 17 wolf-years
**Status:** Minted (Brave tribe)

The class traitor. Heir to a Brave aristocratic household. Chose a servant's nickname to his mother's horror.

**His Family:**
- **Mother:** Aggressive defender of birthright. Second-generation Minted — her grandmother was Unminted but convinced a Minted male to marry her. She clawed her way up and will NOT see it undone. Ash is her greatest disappointment.
- **Father:** Quieter. Drinks a little too much. Occasionally says things at dinner that make his wife's jaw tighten. Mildly sympathetic but not brave enough to act on it.

**What He Did:** Served as the Minted conduit for the summoning ritual. This is irreversible treason. His family, his inheritance, his entire future — gone. The Ledger itself now marks him as having participated. There's no going back.

**His Dynamic:** He gave up everything for this. He's watching Monica very carefully to see if she was worth it. Also, he's in love with Pix and trying not to be obvious about it. He's failing.

**His Fear:** That he burned his whole life down for nothing.

---

## Pix

**Full Name:** Pyxaris (named after an ancient Unminted hero)
**Goes By:** Pix, sometimes Pixie
**Age:** 17 wolf-years
**Status:** Unminted

The Heart. Believes without needing proof. When the others had doubts, she's the one who said "we have to try anyway."

**Her Name:** Her mother works as a servant, scrubbing floors in the Vorne household. She named her daughter after Pyxaris the Steadfast — a hero from before the Betrayal, an Unminted wolf who stood against the purge. She wanted her daughter to remember that Unminted wolves used to matter.

Pix hates her full name. Too heavy. But she carries it anyway.

**What She Did:** Watched her faith become real. A Moonspeaker appeared. It worked. She might actually cry.

**Her Dynamic:** Sees something in Monica that Monica doesn't see in herself. This is either profound insight or naïve projection. Monica finds it deeply uncomfortable either way.

**Her Situation with Ash:** She knows. She's known for years. She's not sure what to do about it. There's a revolution to run.

---

## Sorrel

**Full Name:** Sorrel (that's just his name)
**Age:** 17 wolf-years
**Status:** Unminted
**Pix's Twin:** Same litter.

The Mind. Found the bookshop. Found Zeek. Found the ritual.

He was always hanging around bookshops, reading things he shouldn't, asking questions that made shopkeepers nervous. One day he wandered into Zeek's shop and didn't leave.

**His Role:** The planner. The researcher. He knows more about the summoning, the Moonspeakers, the history than anyone his age should. He's been preparing for this moment since childhood.

**What He Did:** Pulled off something that hasn't worked in 900 years. And now he's staring at Monica thinking "we did everything right, why does she look so confused?"

**His Dynamic:** Mildly offended that Monica doesn't seem to understand how significant this is. Also desperate for her to be what they need her to be. Takes notes during conversations. Protective of his sister in a prickly way.

**The Name:** Sorrel is an earthy, common herb — a servant's name. Unassuming. Easy to overlook. He's fine with that. The wolves who underestimate him regret it.

---

## The Twins' Family

**Mother:** Works as a servant in the Vorne household. Cook or groundskeeper. She knows her children sneak out. She covers for them — maybe knowingly, maybe with deliberate ignorance. She named Pix after a hero because she wanted her to remember.

**Father:** Dead or gone. The twins are entirely dependent on the household's goodwill. If they're cast out, they have nothing.

---

## Zeek

**Full Name:** Ezekiel
**Goes By:** Zeek
**Age:** ~1,000 years (Minted wolves age slower)
**Status:** Minted (NOT Brave tribe — TBD which)
**Role:** The Old Mentor

Runs a dusty bookshop in the market district. Part of a secret society — the Keepers — that has been safeguarding ritual knowledge for a thousand years, attempting to facilitate anyone willing to try a restoration.

**His History:**
900 years ago, Zeek attempted to summon his own tribe's Moonspeaker. It failed catastrophically. Everyone else died. He's the only survivor.

The Ledger remembers. A wolf can only serve as the Minted conduit once — then they're "spent." Zeek can never participate in another summoning. He's had 900 years of guilt and preparation to make sure the next attempt succeeds.

**What He's Built:**
The Keepers maintain a network of hidden spaces — safe houses connected by tunnels, hidden rooms behind false walls, passages through the Deep Warrens. The paranoid architecture of a long-persecuted faith. Zeek's bookshop is one node in this network.

He's been cultivating resistance cells across all six tribes for centuries. Ash's group is just the first to be ready.

**His Dynamic with the Kids:** He found Sorrel in his shop years ago — or Sorrel found him. He's trained them, guided them, given them everything he has. He's too old and too known to be at the summoning itself. He sent his students to do what he couldn't.

He's waiting at the shop for news. Either the kids come back with a Moonspeaker, or they don't come back at all.

**His Relationship with Monica:** He's seen this fail before. He's watching to see if she's different. He won't say what he's looking for.

---

## The Cute Pet (Running Gag)

Monica keeps waiting for video game logic to kick in.

> Monica: "So when do I get a familiar?"
>
> Sorrel: "A what?"
>
> Monica: "You know. A small magical companion. Gives advice. Probably sarcastic."
>
> Pix: "...that's not a thing here."
>
> Monica: "It's ALWAYS a thing."

**The Pattern:** She keeps mistaking creatures for potential companions. They're always dangerous.

- Cute fuzzy thing in the tunnels? Venomous.
- Little chirping bird? Carnivorous swarm creature.
- Friendly-looking lizard? Parasitic.
- Regular rat? Just bites her.

**The Payoff:** When she finally DOES get a companion, it's:
- Not cute (at first)
- Not what she expected
- Earned, not given
- Something she saved, or that saved her, or that just... decided

---

# PART FOUR: THE OTHER MOONSPEAKERS

## The Summoning Structure

Monica is the first Moonspeaker. She arrives alone to a tiny, desperate resistance — three teenagers in a cave.

Each tribe summons their own Moonspeaker. One per tribe. Six total.

**Requirements:**
- Correct moon cycle
- The ritual knowledge (preserved by the Keepers)
- At least one Minted wolf from that tribe willing to serve as conduit
- Believers to anchor the call

**The Conduit Rule:** A wolf can only serve as the Ledger conduit once. After that, they're "spent" — the Ledger won't accept them again. This is why Zeek couldn't do it himself.

---

## Monica's Mission

Her job isn't just to BE a Moonspeaker. She has to help the other five tribes summon theirs. This means:
- Finding resistance cells in other tribes
- Convincing them the ritual works (she's proof)
- Helping them find their own Minted traitors
- Navigating tribal politics and old grudges

The Minted will be actively trying to prevent this.

---

## The Other Five Humans (To Be Summoned)

| Tribe | Name | Background | Hook |
|-------|------|------------|------|
| **Brave** | Monica Lansky | Global VP Marketing, 31 | Protagonist — already summoned |
| **Hunter** | Derek Moss | Construction foreman, 52 | Inherited NFT from dead son |
| **Predator** | TJ Jackson | Discord mod, 24 | Knows all the lore, thinks this is his anime moment |
| **Pack** | Ruth Oyelaran | Retired nurse, 68 | Bought matching NFTs with late wife |
| **Stealth** | Alex Reeves | Grad student, 26 | Non-binary, treating it like fieldwork |
| **Roaming** | Marcus Webb | Trust fund backpacker, 29 | Everyone assumes he's useless |

These humans need to be summoned over the course of the series. Each requires Monica (or others) to facilitate.

**Note:** If the Problem Tribe (no Minted left) is Pack or Roaming, that human's summoning becomes a major plot challenge.

---

# PART FIVE: MINTING MECHANICS

## What Moonspeakers Do

They grant ACCESS, not levels.

A Moonspeaker Mints a wolf into the Ledger. That wolf starts at Level 1. Everything after is earned.

**Why this matters:** The Minted claim the Ledger is birthright. Moonspeakers prove it's a lie.

---

## Minting Prerequisites

### Moon Cycles

| Moon | Capacity |
|------|----------|
| New Moon | None |
| Half Moon | 1-3 wolves |
| Full Moon | 7-12 wolves |
| Blood Moon | 30-50 wolves (yearly) |
| Convergence | Unknown (theoretical) |

### Wolf Requirements

**Pack Witness:** Seven wolves vouch with their lives.
**The Trial:** Candidate proves worthiness.
**The Oath:** Candidate declares purpose. Becomes binding.

### Moonspeaker Requirements

| Present | Multiplier |
|---------|------------|
| 1 | Base |
| 2 | 3x |
| 3+ | Exponential |
| All 6 | Unknown |

### The Cost

**Fatigue:** Too many per cycle = collapse.
**Bond Strain:** More wolves = thinner connection.
**The Bleed:** High-volume Minting changes you.

---

# PART SIX: EARTH CONNECTIONS

## The Dimensional Barrier

The original Mint punched a hole between Earth and Primordia. It's been leaking for 1000 years.

**Bond Persistence:** Every original 10k wolf is still connected to their NFT holder. Even if the wolf died. Even if the holder forgot.

**Holder Effect:** Significant NFT events on Earth — sales, burns, community attention — cause bond flickers. Moonspeakers feel surges they can't explain.

---

## Crypto Parallels (Subtle)

| Earth | Primordia |
|-------|-----------|
| Wallet connection | The Bond |
| Gas fees | Minting energy cost |
| Block confirmations | Moon cycles |
| Staking | Wolves commit to causes |
| Burning | Sacrifice for power |
| Diamond hands | Strong bonds |
| Paper hands | Traitors |
| Rugging | The Betrayal |
| The Merge | All six unite |

---

# PART SEVEN: LOCATIONS

## Stage 1: The Cave

The summoning site. Remote, hidden in Brave territory, accessible only through paths Sorrel mapped over years.

Not sustainable. No supplies, no protection from weather, no defenses. They have maybe a day before they need to move.

This is where Monica arrives. Three teenagers. A chalk circle. And a very confused marketing executive.

---

## Stage 2: The Bookshop

Zeek's shop in the market district. Dusty, cramped, unremarkable from the outside. The kind of place you walk past without noticing.

**The Basement:** Has a door that leads somewhere else. Part of the Keeper network — tunnels, hidden rooms, passages through the Deep Warrens.

Monica's first real shelter is a cramped underground room lined with old books, lit by bioluminescent moss, with three teenagers and one ancient wolf staring at her like "so... what now?"

---

## Stage 3: The Sanctuary (Later)

Somewhere in Brave territory, there's a place the Moonspeakers used before the Betrayal. A gathering hall. A sacred site. Abandoned for 900 years.

The Minted know it exists but believe it's cursed, trapped, or empty.

It's not empty. It's waiting.

Getting there is a mid-book or end-of-book goal. It requires crossing hostile territory with a Moonspeaker the entire aristocracy wants dead.

---

# PART EIGHT: THE BRAVE TRIAL

## Part One: The Drop

A cliff. A fall. Water below (probably).

Monica could probably psych herself up for this. Physical courage isn't her problem.

But the drop is just the surface test.

## Part Two: The Truth Circle

After you jump, you stand before the tribe. They ask questions. Any question. You answer honestly. No spin. No framing. No "strategic transparency."

If they sense you're performing — and they will — you fail.

> "Why are you here?"
>
> Monica's instinct: *Give them the answer they want. Unity. Destiny. The cause.*
>
> What comes out: "I… don't know. I didn't choose this. I was pulled out of a meeting I didn't care about into a war I don't understand. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know if I should be."
>
> Silence.
>
> "That's the first true thing you've said since you arrived."

**What she learns:** The line between authenticity and performance. When does "act brave" become "be brave"? When does the mask become the face?

In advertising, you fake it till you make it — and keep faking. In Brave tribe, faking is valid only if you ACTUALLY make it. The performance has to become real.

---

# PART NINE: PLOT STRUCTURE

## Book One: The Awakening

**Act One (Ch 1-8):** Monica summoned by three teenagers in a cave. Meets Ash, Pix, Sorrel, then Zeek. Learns she's Brave tribe — worst match for someone whose whole life is performance. Discovers she's a weapon in a revolution she didn't sign up for.

**Act Two (Ch 9-20):** Training disaster. Keeps getting called out for performing instead of being. Builds trust with crew. Discovers her actual skill — propaganda. First campaign. But the wolves sense she doesn't believe. The Minted send assassins.

**Act Three (Ch 21-28):** Trial approaches. The Drop she can handle. The Truth Circle terrifies her. Everything escalates — assassination, betrayal revealed, first Minting under siege. Has to be real for the first time in her life.

**Cliffhanger:** Passes. First Minting. Then: "There's something you should know about Zeek's summoning. The one that failed."

---

## Series Arc

| Book | Focus | Scope |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1: The Awakening | Arrival, survival, first Minting | One territory |
| 2: The Choir | More Moonspeakers arrive, war goes hot | Multiple territories |
| 3: The First Summoning | 900-year mystery revealed (Zeek's failure) | Primordia-wide |
| 4: The Fragments | Other shards, civilizations | Multi-fragment |
| 5+: The Ledger | What IS it? Who created it? | Cosmic |

---

# PART TEN: THEMES

**Primary:**
- Authenticity vs. Performance — Who are you when you stop optimizing?
- Earned vs. Inherited — Power means nothing if you didn't earn it
- NPC Revolution — The background characters demand to be protagonists

**Secondary:**
- Found family under pressure
- The cost of inaction
- Who writes history?
- Propaganda and truth — where's the line?

---

---

# SAMPLE OPENING

> The last meeting I ever attended was about Q3 projections.
>
> I don't remember what the projections were. I remember the fluorescent lights flickering, and thinking that if I had to hear "synergizing cross-functional deliverables" one more time, I was going to walk into traffic.
>
> Instead, I felt something pull at the center of my chest — a hook I didn't know was there — and the conference room dissolved, and I woke up in a cave.
>
> Three wolves stared at me. They looked young. They looked terrified.
>
> One of them — a scrappy kid with nervous eyes — stepped forward.
>
> "Moonspeaker," he said, dropping to one knee. "We've been waiting for you."
>
> A smaller wolf behind him — his sister, I'd learn — was crying. Actually crying.
>
> The third wolf, sleek and aristocratic despite the dirt on his fur, just watched me. Evaluating. I knew that look. I'd given that look in a thousand conference rooms.
>
> "Cool," I said. "Quick question. What the fuck?"
