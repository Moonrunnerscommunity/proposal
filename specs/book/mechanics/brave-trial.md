# The Brave Trial

## Part One: The Drop

A cliff. A fall. Water below (probably).

Physical courage. Monica could psych herself up for this—it's not her core problem.

But the drop is just the surface test.

## Part Two: The Truth Circle

After you jump, you stand before the tribe. They ask questions. Any question. You answer honestly.

No spin. No framing. No "strategic transparency."

If they sense you're holding back—you fail.

> What comes out: "Because I said no once. To something that mattered. And I've regretted it every day since."

> Silence.

> Kael: "That's not a reason to fight a war."

> Monica: "No. But it's why I'm not running."

## What She Learns

The difference between leaping and falling.

Falling is letting go because you're too tired to hold on.

Leaping is choosing to jump when you could stay safe.

She's spent her life staying safe. The Brave trial isn't about surviving the fall—it's about choosing to jump anyway.
